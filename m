I've had a quick look over and there are no obvious errors.

I wonder if the of_iomap() and related calls should print an
error if they fail as all the examples here are of the form
of:

	ptr = of_iomap(reource)
	if (!ptr) {
		pr_err("cannot remap resource\n");
		...
		return ERR;
	}

Maybe we should look into this post this patch series.

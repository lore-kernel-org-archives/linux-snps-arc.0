So I got around to addressing this - now that someone actually is trying to use
NPTL (which uses llock/scond) on ARC700 lacking those instructions. However given
that we are going this route, FWIW ARM kernel got rid of this syscall with
db695c0509d6ec ("ARM: remove user cmpxchg syscall") citing some security hole.
Even of we were to disregard, the code at the time had some open code MM trickery,
which I'd rather not replicate. My use case is simple - I only need to support UP
config - and a simple {get,put}_user would suffice - given that that can
potentially take a TLB refill Miss or worse still a full page fault. I'm going to
cook that patch to add that syscall, but wanted to get some thoughts ahead of that.

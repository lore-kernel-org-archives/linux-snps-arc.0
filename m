Yeah, the bit_spin_lock()/__bit_spin_unlock() race described in f75d48644c56a
boils down to concurrent atomic_long_set_release() vs
atomic_long_fetch_or_acquire(), which really needs to work.

I'll keep digging. In the meantime, Vineet, do you have any useful crash
logs and do you only see the crashes in certain configurations (e.g. SMP but
!CONFIG_ARC_HAS_LLSC)?

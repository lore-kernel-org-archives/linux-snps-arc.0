if the pointer is bogus, we currently return -EFAULT, is that not enough ! I'm 
fine if u want to change that to segv.

No exactly your situation. In your case the TLB entry *did* exist with Read 
permission. What I was pointing to is that case where it woudl vanish between user 
reading the backing page and making a syscall !

I'm not sure what you mean here. I'm fine with adding segv kill semantics, but 
don't think complexity for get_user is worth it !

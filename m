So I also wondered about this when debugging the SMP bringup on FPGA last year. It
seems kernel code never changes this field and only sets it up so it would be OK
to do above.

However most arches seem to use the per thread "soft" value (x86 uses a per cpu
"soft" value"), blackfin seems to be using a hardware value.
However if the value can't possibly be changes (by say scheduler etc) then there
is no point retrieving it from memory - if it is relatively cheap derive it from
to core reg.

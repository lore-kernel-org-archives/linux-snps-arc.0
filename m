I'm OK with that, but like your comments on the last one I think it might fit
better as a __weak function.  I think there were also some questions as to
whether these should actually be empty functions or not.  I'm really happy with
either way.

Since this is all out of my wheelhouse, can one of the PCI maintainers chime in
as to what I should do here?

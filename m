Yes, but that's pretty minimal info.

There's also vdso, the program interpreter (ldso), and theoretically
other things the kernel might add. I agree you _could_ track most of
this (and all if you want to open /proc/self/maps), but it seems
hackish and wrong (violating clean boundaries between userspace and
kernel responsibility).

That seems like a rather arbitrary expectation and I'm not sure why
you'd expect it to result in less fragmentation rather than more. For
example if it started from 1GB and worked down, you'd immediately
reduce the contiguous free space from ~3GB to ~2GB, and if it started
from the bottom and worked up, brk would immediately become
unavailable, increasing mmap pressure elsewhere.

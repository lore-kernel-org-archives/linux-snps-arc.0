By *not* limiting yourself to the bottom 1GB, you'll almost immediately
fragment the address space even worse.  Just looking at 'ls' as a
hopefully-good example of a typical app, it maps:

	linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffef5eef000)
	libselinux.so.1 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libselinux.so.1 (0x00007fb3657f5000)
	libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007fb36543b000)
	libpcre.so.3 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpcre.so.3 (0x00007fb3651c9000)
	libdl.so.2 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 (0x00007fb364fc5000)
	/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007fb365c3f000)
	libpthread.so.0 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007fb364da7000)

The VDSO wouldn't move, but look at the distribution of mapping 6 things
into a 3GB address space in random locations.  What are the odds you have
a contiguous 1GB chunk of address space?  If you restrict yourself to the
bottom 1GB before running out of room and falling back to a sequential
allocation, you'll prevent a lot of fragmentation.

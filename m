Hi Guys,
Since v4.19-rc1 we are getting a serious regression on platforms with ARC architecture.
The kernel have become unstable and spontaneously crashes on LTP tests execution / IO tests or
even on boot.

I don't know exactly what breaks but bisect clearly assign the blame to this commit:
84c6591103db ("locking/atomics, asm-generic/bitops/lock.h: Rewrite using atomic_fetch_*()")
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/84c6591103dbeaf393a092a3fc7b09510825f6b9

Reverting the commit solves this problem.

I tested v4.19-rc1 on ARM (wandboard, i.mx6, 32bit, quard core, ARMv7) which uses same
generic bitops implementation and it works fine.

Do you have any ideas what went wrong?

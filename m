Previous multi slot implementation was removed as nobody used it and
nobody tested it. There are lots of mistakes in previous implementation
which are not related to request serialization
like lack of slot switch / lack of adding slot id to CIU commands / ets...
So obviously it was never tested and never used at real multi slot hardware.

In current implementation data transfers and commands to different
hosts (slots) are serialized internally in the dw_mmc driver. We have
request queue and when .request() is called we add new request to the
queue. We take new request from the queue only if the previous one
has already finished.

So although hosts (slots) have separate locks (mmc_claim|release_host())
the requests to different slots are serialized by driver.

Isn't that enough?
I'm not very familiar with SD/SDIO/(e)MMC specs so my assumptions might be wrong
in that case please correct me.

Nevertheless we had to deal somehow with existing hardware which
has multislot dw mmc controller and both slots are used...

This patch at least shouldn't break anything for current users (which use
it in single slot mode)

Moreover we tested this dual-slot implementation and don't catch any problems
(probably yet) except bus performance decrease in dual-slot mode (which is
quite expected).

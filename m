Hi Greg,

First of all thanks for your reply.

I am sorry that the patch's cc-list is too big. This was the list of people that the
get_maintainers.pl script produced. I already recognized that it was a huge number of
people, but I didn't want to remove anyone from the list because I wasn't sure who
would be interested in this patch set. Do you have any suggestion who to remove from
the list? I don't want to annoy anyone with useless emails.

The reason why I don't use the kobject's name is that I don't restrict the names that
are used for VAS/VAS segments. Accordingly, it would be allowed to use a name like
"foo/bar/xyz" as VAS name. However, I am not sure what would happen in the sysfs if I
would use such a name for the kobject. Especially, since one could think of another
VAS with the name "foo/bar" whose name would conflict with the first one although it
not necessarily has any connection with it.

I actually use both the internal kobject refcount to keep track of how often a
VAS/VAS segment is referenced and this 'refcount' variable to keep track how often
the VAS is actually attached to a task. They not necessarily must be related to each
other. I can rename this variable to attach_count. Or if preferred I can
alternatively only use the kobject reference counter and remove this variable
completely though I would loose information about how often the VAS is attached to a
task because the kobject reference counter is also used to keep track of other
variables referencing the VAS.

Thank you. I will have a look at these functions.

Oh sorry, I forgot to add this file. I will add the ABI descriptions for future
submissions.

OK. I was following the sysfs example in the documentation that used scnprintf, but
if sprintf is preferred, I can change this.

I will change this.

See above.

I was using the __* naming scheme for functions that have no other meaning outside of
my source file. But I can change this if people don't like it. I have no strong
feelings about the names of the functions.

There was no specific reason why I declared the functions as inline except my hope to
reduce the function call for some of my very small functions. I can look more closely
at this and check whether there is some real benefit in inlining them and if not
remove it.

Thank you very much.

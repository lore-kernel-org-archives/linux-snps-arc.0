I took a look at these, and it seems their phys_to_dma() usage is doing 
the thing which we subsequently formalised as dma_map_resource(). I've 
had a crack at a quick patch to update the CESA driver; qcom_nandc looks 
slightly more complex in that the changes probably need to span the BAM 
dmaengine driver as well.

In the process, though, I stumbled across gen_pool_dma_alloc() - yuck, 
something needs doing there, for sure...

Robin.

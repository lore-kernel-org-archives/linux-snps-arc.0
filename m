As an aside, do these imply a state machine of sorts - does a driver needs to 
always call map_single first ?

My original point of contention/confusion is the specific combinations of API and 
direction, specifically for_cpu(TO_DEV) and for_device(TO_CPU)

Semantically what does dma_sync_single_for_cpu(TO_DEV) even imply for a non dma 
coherent arch.
Your tables below have "none" for both, implying it is unlikely to be a real 
combination (for ARM and ARC atleast).

The other case, actually @dir TO_CPU, independent of for_{cpu, device}? implies 
driver intends to touch it after the call, so it would invalidate any stray lines, 
unconditionally (and not just for speculative prefetch case).

Can you please explain in some more detail, TO_CPU row, why invalidate is 
conditional sometimes.

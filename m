Subject: [PATCH 0/4 v6] drm: Add support of ARC PGU display controller
List-ID: <linux-snps-arc@lists.infradead.org>
Message-ID: <1461071980-5916-1-git-send-email-abrodkin@synopsys.com>
To: linux-snps-arc@lists.infradead.org

This series add support of ARC PGU display controller.
ARC PGU is a quite simple byte streamer that gets data from the framebuffer
and pushes it to hte connected encoder (DP or HDMI).

It was tested on ARC SDP boards (axs101/103 in particular).

Note following series (v6) that introduces drm_connector_register_all()
is a prerequisite now: https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/4/19/299

Changes v5 -> v6:
 * "arc: Add our own implementation of fb_pgprotect()" was already applied to
   ARC's tree and available in linux-next:
   http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/commit/?id=e5e0a65cd20a7a892a87e6bd73bdc3d83726d725

Changes v4 -> v5:
 * Removed encode node from DT bindings example (as suggested by Rob)

Changes v3 -> v4:
 * Main driver author is now set properly (thanks Carlos for all your efforts)
 * Implemented correct hsync and vsync setup (thanks Jose)
 * Dummy call-backs were removed (as suggested by Daniel)
 * Obsolete load()/unload() call-backs were removed (as suggested by Daniel)
 * With above in mind we were able to adopt recently introduced
   drm_connector_register_all()/drm_connector_unregister_all()
 * Implemented setup of properties (uncached) for FB user-pages
 * Minor clean-up in DT binding docs and axs10x_mb.dtsi

Changes v2 -> v3:
 * Improved failure path if arcpgu_connector wasn't allocated.
 * Fixed driver building as module.
 * Implemented uncached mapping of user-space FB pages.
 * Again updated DT bindings docs.

Changes v1 -> v2:
 * Clean-up of DT bindings documentation.
 * Added missing "pxlclk" clock in axs10x_mb.dtsi.

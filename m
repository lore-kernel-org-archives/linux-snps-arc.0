Right, for now lets retain that and do a sweeping audit of @direction - to me it 
seems extraneous (as it did 10 years ago), but I'm not an expert in this are so 
perhaps it is needed for some device / arches and it would be good to understand 
that finally.

Not calling names or anything here, but it doesn't exist for sg variants, because 
I didn't write that code :-)
It was introduced by your commi:

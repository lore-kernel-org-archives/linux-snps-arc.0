Synopsys has a product called IP Prototyping Kit which is a bundle of HAPSDX +
PCIE RC IP + drivers + Development Board. This driver was implemented originally
to serve this IPK but it can be used by SoC that use the Synopsys PCIe RC IP.
"ipk" would say that the driver is usable only in the IP Prototyping Kits which
is not 100% true, it is usable in any SoC with Synopsys IP or in limit serve as
a base for specific SoC drivers.
Suggestions: "pcie-dw-soc-agnostic", "pcie-dw-ipk", "pcie-dw-haps-prototyping"

What do you think?

I am going to fetch your repo and get the host/pcie-synopsys to generate the
next patch version.

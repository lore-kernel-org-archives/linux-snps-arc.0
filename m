Oh urgh. Is that the only way ARC can do text patching? We've actually
considered something like this on x86 at some point, but there we have
the 'fun' detail that the i-fetch window does not in fact align with L1
size on all uarchs, so that got complicated real fast.

I'm assuming you've looked at what x86 currently does and found
something like that doesn't work for ARC?

It is what x86 does. And I've been fairly adamant about doing so. When
the kernel text is compromised, do you really want to continue running
it?

I dare not ask...

So do you have a 2 byte opcode that traps unconditionally? In that case
I'm thinking you could do something like x86 does. And it would avoid
that NOP padding you do to get the alignment.

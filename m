Well, x86 does support DT to some extent. There's 2 platforms and the
DT unittests build and run on x86.

Actually, we can remove "%.dtb.S %.dtb.o" because we don't need those
as top-level build targets. Must have been a copy-n-paste relic from
before having common rules.

Okay, but that shouldn't affect any of this. We only build *.dtb.S
when doing built-in dtbs.

Right, I found that too.

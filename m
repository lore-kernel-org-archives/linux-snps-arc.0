Actually I did :-)

The discussion above digressed from original intent of the patch and instead 
veered of into need for handling __builtin_trap() for ARC and a fallback abort() 
with same semantics etc which I'd agreed to do above. They are upstream

2017-12-08 af1be2e21203 ARC: handle gcc generated __builtin_trap for older compiler
2017-12-20 f5a16b93e629 ARC: handle gcc generated __builtin_trap()

However we missed this large stack issue and the -Werror=return-type warning for ARC.

Let me check the patch again and get back here !

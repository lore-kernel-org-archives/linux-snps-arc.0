I'm not sure I understand - does this require specific PMU/arch support - as in
multiple conditions feeding to same counter. How does perf user make use of this
info - I tried googling around but can't seem to find anything which explains the
semantics.

I can see that group events to work on ARC (although in our case a counter can
cont one condition at a time only) and the results seem to be similar whther we
group or not.

Again when you say co-scheduled what do you mean - why would anyone use the event
grouping - is it when they only have 1 counter and they want to count 2
conditions/events at the same time - isn't this same as event multiplexing ?

Sorry, I didn't realize we are missing the stack trace now which you removed from 
the patch - why ? Did u intend to reduce inline generated code for the stack dump 
calls - which sounds like a great idea. But it would only work for the synchronous 
abort() but not when builtin translates to actual trap inducing instruction.

Indeed so. I didn't run into this in my testing as my for-curr has an ARC specific 
version (predating Sudip's generic version- because of build failures in our 
internal regression jobs etc). That version only calls panic.

abort() is only likely to be called due to __builtin_trap() for arches where gcc 
doesn't have a target specific defn of it. And thus adding the call from BUG() 
will cause the recursion as you found out with Sudip's generic version and thus 
needs a fixup.

Ugh, I thought the arm64 is in upstream already. Note that this patch
just takes what is in this arm64 fix and makes it effective for all
architectures. So I will wait with v2 until it merges upstream.

So, Will, will you incorporate Thomas' comments into your arm64 fix?

Something like this or do you want a comment yet?
        unsigned int op =         (encoded_op & 0x70000000) >> 28;
        unsigned int cmp =        (encoded_op & 0x0f000000) >> 24;
        int oparg = sign_extend32((encoded_op & 0x00fff000) >> 12, 12);
        int cmparg = sign_extend32(encoded_op & 0x00000fff, 12);

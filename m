Well I think maybe it worth mentioning only 32-bit and 64-bit alignments in
this particular case because as it was mentioned initially in the comment there're
3 pointers before "data" field and for 32-bit machines I guess we may safely
assume that a pointer size is 32-bit.

This leaves us only one problematic situation 32-bit instead of 64-bit alignment.

Well ARC and ARMv7 are 32-bit machines as well still both have
a special instructions to read/write 64-bit data.

See it was just a trigger case but other GPUs that use or will use
DRM GPU scheduler are good candidates to it that problem and not to
mention some other users of atomic64_t.

But from you above comment I may deduce that m68k doesn't have
instructions for 64-bit data; in that case there's no reason to worry
at least about struct devres_node :)

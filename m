Functionality wise they are identical (only the address of aux regs used to
program them are different). Either can be configured to interrupt-on-limit or
free-run-and-wrap-around. So we can indeed consider them 2 instances. ARC Linux
uses timer0 for tick handling, timer1 for gtod.

Do you prefer they not be differentiated as timer0 and timer1 ?

So we have

CLOCKSOURCE_OF_DECLARE(arc_clkevt, "snps,arc-timer0", arc_clockevent_setup);
CLOCKSOURCE_OF_DECLARE(arc_timer1, "snps,arc-timer1", arc_cs_setup_timer1);

I don't know how to achieve above, by keeping the DT names the same.

OK. So to document that this is for clockevent, change the label ?

timer_clkevent: timer {

Latter !

Not sure what you mean to change.

This timer could be present in UP or SMP hardware configs but only usable as
clocksource for UP since it is local and we don't do tick broadcast etc for SMP.

To me clocksource is one level higher in level of abstraction than processor and
thus applies to overall system / SoC than the processor.

A bit remark for better understanding:

All card settings change are serialized too. These settings are applied
after slot switch before execution of new request for this slot.

So situations like calling any host_0 ops while another host (host_1) is active
are handled by current code.

This is example of simultaneous ops calls for both slots:

host (slot) 0    | host (slot) 1
-----------------------------------
h0->set_ios()    |    h1->set_ios()
h0->request()    |    h1->request()
h0->set_ios()    |    h1->set_ios()
h0->request()    |    h1->request()
h0->request()    |
h0->request()    |
h0->request()    |

How it will be serialized in the mmc driver:

h0->set_ios()   // h0 settings save
h1->set_ios()   // h1 settings save
h0->request()   // apply settings for h0 and do request
------ slot switch to h1 ------
h1->request()   // apply settings for h1 and do request
h0->set_ios()   // h0 settings save
h1->set_ios()   // h1 settings save
------ slot switch to h0 ------
h0->request()   // apply settings for h0 and do request
------ slot switch to h1 ------
h1->request()   // apply settings for h1 and do request
------ slot switch to h0 ------
h0->request()   // do request (no new settings to apply)
h0->request()   // do request (no new settings to apply)
h0->request()   // do request (no new settings to apply)

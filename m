FYI, I have a plan to merge dma_direct_ops and dma_noncoherent_ops
and make the decision to use cache flushing run time controllable
with a flag in struct device based on existing dynamic selection
in e.g. arm, arm64 and mips.  It will probably take a few more merge
windows to get there, but once it is done you should be able to take
easy advantage of it.

dma-noncoherent.h already includes dma-mapping.h, so this is not
required.

need_coh is only used twice, it might be cleaner to remove the
variable and just open code the DMA_ATTR_NON_CONSISTENT check.
And for extra points remove the need_kvaddr variable as well.

Also you probably want to do the equivalent change in arch_dma_free
as well.

Note that due to your use of asm-generic/dma-mapping.h we already
default to dma_noncoherent_ops if no per-device ops is set.  So we
could skip the else branch here I think.

Hi Alexey.

Really?

I can do 'make ARCH=arc headers_install'
with the latest Linus' tree.

I see the following warnings, but possible to install kernel headers.

./scripts/gcc-version.sh: line 26: arc-linux-gcc: command not found
./scripts/gcc-version.sh: line 27: arc-linux-gcc: command not found


If ARC compiler is not found in PATH,
those warnings are displayed with v4.16 or older as well.

I do not see much difference in the behavior.


I am trying to fix even those warnings
by eliminating unneeded compiler invocation.  It is WIP.

I do not think it is a good practice
to forcibly set CROSS_COMPILE that users may not have.

arch/m68k/Makefile uses cc-cross-prefix helper
to set the first found compiler.

I think the log of commit 316d55d55f49eca44
is a good source to know the background of this change.

Now Kconfig requires the target compiler.
So, it does not make sense to
do defconfig with non-existing compiler.

I'd recommend to not hard-code CROSS_COMPILE.



Thanks.

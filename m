Hi Eugeniy,

sorry for the delay, the driver is different from what I'm
used to so I needed focuses attention and it took some time.

This is looking good! Just a few small things I want you to fix
(we can certainly queue this for the next kernel):

Replace this with:
#include <linux/gpio/driver.h>

Drivers should only need to include that file. (Also move away from
mm_gpio_chip as per below.)

Why?

I would prefer to move away from using this. Just create a regular driver
please. Just struct gpio_chip and add a member
void __iomem *base; instead of referring to mmchip.regs.

In fact I want to rewrite all mm_gpio_chips but I just haven't had time.

Please rename the variable "gpio" to "offset".

This is clearer because "gpio" becomes quite ambigous.

I think with the recent code changes in gpiolib you do not need to define
this function at all.

Another reason to not use mm_gpio_chip: just rely on standard twocell
translation and you can delete this.

Speling

Also should be "Synopsys GPIO via CREG" as this is likely just
for Synopsys and not general purpose.

Move this documentation into the driver instead.

OK

Use the existing ngpios attribute for this, see gpio.txt

Move this into a lookup table in the driver instead, and match
the lookup table to the compatible string. The format of the
register is known for a certain compatible, right?

> +Optional properties:

Default values for different lines can be achieved by hogs
if it's OK to tie them up perpetually, else work on creating generic
inialization values in gpio.txt and implement that in
gpiolib-of.c for everyone. This discussion comes up from time
to time.

Sorry I didn't try your proposed fix earlier - was away for a couple of days.

But that newer version with fixed lib/dma-noncoherent.c still doesn't work on ARC.

USB ECHI controller fails like that:
------------------------->8-------------------------
usb 1-1: new high-speed USB device number 2 using ehci-platform
usb 1-1: can't set config #1, error -32
------------------------->8-------------------------

Again with entire series reverted USB starts to work.
Let's wait for other arches previously affected to update on their status.

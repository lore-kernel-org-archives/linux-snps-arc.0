There is, you seems don't see it.

Currently:
 User:
  prepares sg-list

 DMA driver:
  a) iterates over it, and
  b) if sg_len is bigger than block it re-splits it.

New approach:

 User:
  a) gets DMA channel and its properties
  b) prepares sg-list taking into consideration block size

 DMA driver:
  a) uses the given sg-list and for sake of simplicity bails out if
something wrong with it

So, it means in some cases (where entry is big enough) we have to
prepare list *and* re-split it. It's really performance consuming (like
UART case where buffer is small enough and latency like above matters).

There are two type of descriptors: SW and HW. That flag about SW
descriptor, so, it in most cases has nothing to do with the actual entry
size.

No, you completely missed the point.

With new approach we do the preparation only once per descriptor /
transfer and in one place where the sg-list is created.

If it's active it will be freed.
Otherwise caller should check somewhere that descriptor fails.

But actually this is fragile and we need to monitor failed descriptors.

Nope, we need to amend virt-chan API for that. I'm on it. Will send a
series soon.

Okay, The best way to do that is to create functions which take struct
chip and do that. Re-use them in runtime PM hooks.

But you still need to learn a bit about runtime PM. There is no harm to
call clk_enable() twice in a raw if you guarantee you do the opposite
(twice call clk_disable()) on tear down.

Also I would reconsider clock (un)preparation in those hooks. Why do you
need that part? It's resource consuming.

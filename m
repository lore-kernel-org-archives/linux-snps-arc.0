Yes, that's right. Thanks for giving me the pointer to this. I should have researched
more carefully before starting to work at VAS segments.

I don't agree here. VAS segments are basically in-memory files that are handled by
the kernel directly without using a file system. Hence, if an application uses a VAS
segment to store data the same rules apply as if it uses a file. Everything that it
saves in the VAS segment might be accessible by other applications. An application
using VAS segments should be aware of this fact. In addition, the resources that are
represented by a VAS segment are not leaked. As I said, VAS segments are much like
files. Hence, if you don't want to use them any more, delete them. But as with files,
the kernel will not delete them for you (although something like this can be added).

I don't agree that this is a bug at all. If there is a conflict in the memory layout
of the ASes the application simply cannot use this first class virtual address space.
Every application that wants to use first class virtual address spaces should check
for error return values and handle them.

This situation is similar to mapping a file at some special address in memory because
the file contains pointer based data structures and the application wants to use
them, but the kernel cannot map the file at this particular position in the
application's AS because there is already a different conflicting mapping. If an
application wants to do such things, it should also handle all the errors that can
occur.

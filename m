What's the tentative plan for this hitting mainline since I have pending ARC HSDK 
DT changes to use the new DT binding. If it is not goign to be 4.14-rc4, is it OK 
for me to pull this branch into ARC tree as well and send to Linus' way before 
armsoc pull request. Does it matter if Linux gets same changes via 2 tree !

P.S. Consider this no-ob question since I don't use merge commits in my typical 
workflow !

Sorry I added you as a subject matter expert but didn't provide enough context.

The original issue [1] was perf failing to build on ARC due to perf tools needing
a copy of unistd.h but this thread [2] was a small side issue of auto-detecting
libc variaint in perf tools where despite uClibc tools, glibc is declared to be
detected, due to uClibc's historical hack of defining __GLIBC__. So __GLIBC__ is
not sufficient (and probably not the right interface to begin wtih) to ensure glibc.

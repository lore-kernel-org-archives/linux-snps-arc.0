That approach can't be used because the reference clock value will change in the
next firmware release.  The new release will have a reference clock of 28224000
Hz instead of the usual 27000000 Hz, so we need to have a way to distinguish
between them. Because of that we can't have only one master clock unless you
state to users that they have to change the reference clock value when using the
new firmware release. Stephen suggested to use two DT files (one for each
firmware release), but as Vineet said this would be annoying to the user so I am
trying to use another solution so that only one DT file is required.

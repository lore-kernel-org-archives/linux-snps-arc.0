I don't want to say that the interface provided by MAP_SHARED is bad. I am only
arguing that VAS segments and the interface that they provide have an advantage over
the existing ones in my opinion. However, Matthew Wilcox also suggested in some
earlier mail that VAS segments could be exported to user space via a special purpose
filesystem. This would enable users of VAS segments to also just use some special
files to setup the shared memory regions. But since the VAS segment itself already
knows where at has to be mapped in the virtual address space of the process, the
establishing of the shared memory region would be very easy for the user.

If I read the documentation to DAX filesystems correctly, it is indeed possible to us
them to create files that life purely in NVM. I wasn't fully aware of this feature.
Thanks for the pointer.

However, the main contribution of this patchset is actually the idea of first class
virtual address spaces and that they can be used to allow processes to have multiple
different views on the system's main memory. For us, VAS segments were another logic
step in the same direction (from first class virtual address spaces to first class
address space segments). However, if there is already functionality in the Linux
kernel to achieve the exact same behavior, there is no real need to add VAS segments.
I will continue thinking about them and either find a different situation where the
currently available interface is not sufficient/too complicated or drop VAS segments
from future version of the patch set.

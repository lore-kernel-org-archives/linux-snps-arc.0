Not sure where this is heading. Broken concept was introduced by disabling
preemption around show_regs() to silence x86 smp_processor_id() splat in 2009.

>From initial testing, none so far. show_regs() is simply pretty printing the
passed pt_regs and decoding the current task, which agreed could move to a
different CPU (likely will due to console/printk calls), but I don't see how that
could mess up its mm or othe rinternal plumbing which it prints.

Right so the first step is reverting the disabled semantics for ARC and do some
heavy testing to make sure any fallouts are addressed etc. And if that works, then
propagate this change to core itself. Low risk strategy IMO - agree ?

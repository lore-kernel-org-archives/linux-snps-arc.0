For !LLSC atomics, ARC has always had atomic_set() DTRT even in the git revision
of 2016. The problem was not in atomics, but the asymmetric way slub bit lock etc
worked (haven't checked if this changed), i.e.

     slab_lock() -> bit_spin_lock() -> test_and_set_bit()    # atomic
     slab_unlock() -> __bit_spin_unlock() -> __clear_bit()    # non-atomic

And with v4.19-rc1, we have essentially reverted f75d48644c56a due to 84c6591103db
("locking/atomics, asm-generic/bitops/lock.h: Rewrite using atomic_fetch_*()")

So what we have with 4.19-rc1 is

   static inline void __clear_bit_unlock(unsigned int nr, volatile unsigned long *p)
   {
     unsigned long old;
     p += ((nr) / 32);
     old = // some typecheck magic on *p
     old &= ~(1UL << ((nr) % 32));
     atomic_long_set_release((atomic_long_t *)p, old);
   }

So @p is being r-m-w non atomically. The lock variant uses atomic op...

   int test_and_set_bit_lock(unsigned int nr, volatile unsigned long *p)
   { 
      ...
      old = atomic_long_fetch_or_acquire(mask, (atomic_long_t *)p);
      ....
   }

Now I don't know why we don't see the issue with LLSC atomics, perhaps race window
reduces due to less verbose code itself etc..

Am I missing something still ?

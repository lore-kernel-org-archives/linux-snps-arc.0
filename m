So the big issue is that the minimum alignment of a buffer allocated with
devm_kmalloc() and friends is different (lower) than when allocated with
kmalloc().

On 32-bit, it's only aligned to 4 bytes. Ugh.
I wouldn't be surprised if some callers assume it to be cacheline-aligned...

Which means blind conversions to the devm_*() versions can be dangerous.

Yes.

The pipe is used when

  - we want to make sure the weaker prerequisite exists

  - but, we do not want to execute the recipe
    even if the weaker prerequisite is updated


In this case, we want to execute the recipe _all_the_time_.

We compare the timestamp between %.dtb and %.dts in the sub-directory.

We never know the real depenency until the following recipe is run
     $(Q)$(MAKE) $(build)=$(dtstree) $(dtstree)/$@



PHONY += dtbs
dtbs: | dtc
      $(Q)$(MAKE) $(build)=$(dtstree)

Here 'dtbs' is a PHONY target.
We always want to run the recipe.
The pipe operator is not sensible.

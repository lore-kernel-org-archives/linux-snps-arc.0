Using hardcoded DT names in generic code is total BS and I slap myself for missing
that in reviewing 8/9. Please fix it !

FWIW, it is OK to have such hardcoding in say AXS103 DTS and AXS103 platform code
but it is not the way to go in setup.c

Yeah I fixed all those !

This is all moot once we fix the orig problem.

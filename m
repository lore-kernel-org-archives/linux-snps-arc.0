I am all for it. But I would postpone this removal to 4.17.
The reason is rather ugly. 13th patch is already in arc tree.
We would need to shuffle the patch or coordinate pull requests.
I think that it is not worth it. There is no real hurry.
I doubt that the would be any new user in the meantime.

Best Regards,

PS: I have just pushed 12 patches into printk.git for-4.16 branch.
I will merge this to linux-next branch on Monday. I will not
be around the computer over the weekend...

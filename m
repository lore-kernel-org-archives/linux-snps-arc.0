If you do not mind, I would prefer this series to go in, as-is, and
clean up the initrd_start/initrd_end assignment as a follow up patch
series. The reason is mostly that I am not yet clear on the timing of
these operations between the architecture resolving the virtual address
and the initrd code starting to use it.

Would that sound reasonable to you?

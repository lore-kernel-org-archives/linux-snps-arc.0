Sure, thanks for pointing there. I will add few lines there after discussion them
here.

Yes, I was not sure about correct value so leaved some gap for future. Also
according to current implementation this value used like a scalar. But I?m
agree bitfield looks more flexible for the future. I think right now I can leave
3 as value for my patch and it could be fixed any time in the future. What
do you think about it?

Thanks, I missed that case. I will fix it.

This one what I fix by next patch. I was trying to make patches separate to make
it easier to understand them. This constant came from last version discussion 
and honestly doesn?t means much. I replaced it with Architecture depended limit
that as I plan would be CONFIG value as well.

This value means maximum number of pages we can move away from the next
vma. The less value means less security but less memory fragmentation. Any way
on 64bit systems memory fragmentation is not such a big problem.

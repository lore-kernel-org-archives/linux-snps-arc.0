So, we need the kernel configuration to build DT?

I am scared with this idea.

I believe DT files should be able to be compiled
irrespective of the .config because they are
re-used for other projects.

devicetree-rebasing is a subset of the kernel tree
that collects DT.

If you upstream that patch, this will be broken, at least.

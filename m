That doesn't seem correct IMO. A NOT taken conditional branch doesn't change
control flow, so semantically doesn't qualify as a branch.
On ARC, the generic branches event should be mapped to "actually taken branches"
condition i.e.  ijmptak

That seems correct.

Why ? branch-misses is a CPU specific micro-arch state where the a changed control
flow was NOT predicted. If an implementation mispredicts NOT taken branches, those
should actually get counted and be fed to hardware folks to improve the micro-arch.

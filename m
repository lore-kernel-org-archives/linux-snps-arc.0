Subject: [RFC PATCH 0/5] earlycon hang under some conditions

I was testing earlycon with 8250 dw serial console. And it hangs in
these cases:
1/ kernel hang when calling early write function after free_initmem:
a) the earlycon not disabled after the init code(due to keep_bootcon or
   not specify a real console to switch to)
b) the early write func is marked as __init, for example 8250_early.

2/ kernel hang when calling early write function after disable unused
clks/pm domain:
a) the earlycon not disabled after the init code
b) the disable unused clks/pm domain kill the requiered clks/pm
   domain, since they are not referenced by the earlycon.

3/ kernel hang when calling early write function after the serial
   console driver runtime suspended:
a) the earlycon not disabled after the init code
b) the serial console driver's runtime suspend kills the requiered
   clks/pm domain, since they are not referenced by the earlycon.

This serial fix 1/ case only.

Interesting, it seems that the kprobe_fault_handler() has never been called.
Anyway, it is used for handling a page fault in kprobe's user handler or single
stepping. And a page fault in user handler will not hard to fix up. Only a hard
case is a page fault in single stepping. If ARC's kprobes using single-stepping
on copied buffer, it may crashes kernel, since fixup code can not find correct
address without kprobe_fault_handler.

Thank you,

How is any of that not utterly and terminally broken?

Not a fan of this. There is a distinct difference between
oops_in_progress and dropping into kgdb in that you don't ever expect to
return/survive oopses, whereas we do expect to survive kgdb.

Also, how does kgdb work at all without actual NMIs ?

So no, NAK on this.

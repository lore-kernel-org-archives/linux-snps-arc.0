Presumably someone using this would just use the "clk_ignore_unused"
and "pd_ignore_unused" kernel parameters to help them...  In this case
that seems fine to me.  The "early" boot console is early because it
can't rely on all of the generic OS mechanisms to do things super
cleanly, so requiring the user to know that they should add the extra
command line arguments seems sane.

But even if we had cpufreq driver going - I don't think it would be usable for 
doing large freq switches, since in current implementations of SoCs (or fpga), the 
clk/pll etc driving core (and all timers etc) are not fixed like say ARM. And as 
discussed before (and pointed to by tglx), timer subsys can't tolerate (on 
purpose) such large drifts.

But the above patch is clk driver agnostic and it would have to be added each clk 
driver (axs10x, hsdk - both in linux-next) ?
Also note that this code is using a new / adhoc DT binding cpu-freq in cou node to 
do the override - is that acceptable ?

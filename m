The proposed patch (which I attached in the earlier mail) was breaking
the build unless weak abort() is exported. So, ideally the export of
weak abort() and the proposed patch should have been part of a series.
But afaik, the export has been done to fix another build failure reported
by Vineet.

Andrew, I think the best way now is to apply the patch sent by Arnd,
and I will send a separate patch to remove abort() after proper testing.

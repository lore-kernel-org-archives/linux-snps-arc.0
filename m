I don't think there's a production ARC toolchain with gcc 4.9 which we can use yet
- Claudiu is still in the the middle of upstreaming the new ARC HS port bits so
things are still in flight there. These tools are off of github !

Maybe it's better to add the flag to

Sure, but I prefer this to be only for gcc 4.8 as this warning seems to be
healthy in small doses :-) At least it keeps the door open for future discussion
with gcc guys !

The following nested construct actually works - does that look OK to you ?

ARCH_CFLAGS += -O3 $(call cc-ifversion, -lt, 0408, $(call
cc-disable-warning,maybe-uninitialized,))

Subject: [PATCH v3] devres: Explicitly align datai[] to 64-bit
List-ID: <linux-snps-arc@lists.infradead.org>
Message-ID: <20180709134550.29541-1-abrodkin@synopsys.com>
To: linux-snps-arc@lists.infradead.org

data[] must be 64-bit aligned even on 32-bit architectures because
it might be accessed by instructions that require aligned memory arguments.

One example is "atomic64_t" type accessed by special atomic instructions
which may read/write entire 64-bit word.

Atomic instructions are a bit special compared to normal loads and stores.
Even if normal loads and stores may deal with unaligned data, atomic
instructions still require data to be aligned because it's hard to manage
atomic value that spans through multiple cache lines or even MMU pages.
And hardware just raises an alignment fault exception.

The problem with previously used approach is that depending on ABI
"long long" type of a particular 32-bit CPU might be aligned to
8-, 16-, 32- or 64-bit boundary. Which will get in the way of mentioned
above atomic instructions.

Consider the following snippet:
|        struct mystruct {
|                atomic64_t myvar;
|        }
|
|        struct mystruct *p;
|        p = devm_kzalloc(dev, sizeof(*p), GFP_KERNEL);

Here address of "myvar" will match  data[] in "struct devres",
that said if "data" is not 64-bit aligned atomic instruction will
fail on the first access to "myvar".

Subject: [PATCH 0/2] drm/arcpgu: Get use of dedicated memory area for frame
 buffer
List-ID: <linux-snps-arc@lists.infradead.org>
Message-ID: <1461767701-12208-1-git-send-email-abrodkin@synopsys.com>
To: linux-snps-arc@lists.infradead.org

This mini-series allows to allocate frame buffer memory in desired
location. Allocation of a frame buffer memory in a special memory region
allows bypassing of so-called IO Coherency aperture which is typically set
as a range 0x8z-0xAz.

I.e. all data traffic to PGU bypasses IO Coherency block
and saves its bandwidth for other peripherals.

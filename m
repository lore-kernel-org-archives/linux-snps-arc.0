This looks very useful, thanks. Of course, s390 is quite special and does
not work nicely with this patch (yet), mostly because of our dynamic page
table levels/folding. Still need to figure out what can be fixed in the arch
code and what would need to be changed in the test module. See below for some
generic comments/questions.

At least one real bug in the s390 code was already revealed by this, which
is very nice. In pmd/pud_bad(), we also check large pmds/puds for sanity,
instead of reporting them as bad, which is apparently not how it is expected.

Why is P4D_SIZE missing in the VADDR_TEST calculation?

For pgd/p4d/pud_clear(), we only clear if the page table level is present
and not folded. The memset() here overwrites the table type bits, so
pud_clear() will not clear anything on s390 and the pud_none() check will
fail.
Would it be possible to OR a (larger) random value into the table, so that
the lower 12 bits would be preserved?

This will populate the pud with a pmd pointer that does not point to the
beginning of the pmd table, but to the second entry (because of how
VADDR_TEST is constructed). This will result in failing pud_bad() check
on s390. Not sure why/how it works on other archs, but would it be possible
to align pmdp down to the beginning of the pmd table (and similar for the
other pxd_populate_tests)?

pgtable_t is arch-specific, and on s390 it is not a struct page pointer,
but a pte pointer. So this will go wrong, also on all other archs (if any)
where pgtable_t is not struct page.
Would it be possible to use pte_free_kernel() instead, and just pass
saved_ptep directly?

Subject: [PATCH 0/3 v5] hsdk: initial port for HSDK board
List-ID: <linux-snps-arc@lists.infradead.org>

This series introduces some required preparations and initial
port of ARC HS Development Kit board with some basic features such
as serial port, USB, SD/MMC and Ethernet.

Essentially we run Linux kernel on all 4 cores (i.e. utilize SMP) and
heavily use IO Coherency for speeding-up DMA-aware peripherals.

Note as opposed to other ARC boards we link Linux kernel to
0x9000_0000 intentionally because cores 1 and 3 configured with DCCM
situated at our more usual link base 0x8000_0000.

Note that two patches of this series ("ARC: Decouple linux kernel memory
address and link address" and "ARC: Set IO-coherency aperture base to 
LINUX_LINK_BASE") are prerequisites for HDSK support as its hardware
configuration differs quite a bit from what we used to have on other
ARC boards.

Eugeniy Paltsev (2):
  ARC: Set IO-coherency aperture base to LINUX_LINK_BASE
  ARC: Decouple linux kernel memory address and link address

Changes v4 -> v5:
 * Move DCCM outside of 0x8000_0000 adress at kernel boot time.
 * Decouple linux kernel memory address and link address.
 * Remove hardcoding of IO-coherency aperture base.
 * Remove reseting CREG_PAE bits as default value is suitable for us.

Changes v3 -> v4:
 * Removed senseless "ranges" property from "memory" node in .dts
 * Refined early-boot code:
    - ICCM relocation should be done on each and every core that sports ICCM
      so we leave it in init_per_cpu(). Even though init_per_cpu() gets called
      on the master core pretty late still it is way much earlier than that
      moment when it might affect us - as it only huts us when addresses in
      0x7z-0x7fff_ffff range are used, i.e. virtual addresses that we don't
      use during init. This also makes code much cleaner compared to
      additional check in case of master etc.

Changes v2 -> v3:
 * Added Rob to Cc-list for DT binding approval
 * Removed mention of prerequsite patch from commit message
 * Removed hsdk_early_init() as hsdk_init_per_cpu() is executed on
   all cores anyways including master
 * Cleaned-up board's .dts a little bit
 * Removed CONFIG_DP83867_PHY from defconfig as it was only used on
   FPGA prototype, on real board we use MICREL PHY which is still selected

Changes v1 -> v2:
 * Update copyright year from 2016 to more up to date 2017
 * Merge early UART clock with AXS10x as in both cases that's 33.3 MHz
 * Bump memory to 1Gb, we don't use more for now because it requires
   trickier IOC setup and usage
 * Update early platform init code:
    - Added missing fixup_pae_regs() to per-cpu init
    - Mark most of functions as "static __init"
    - Use writel_relaxed() for setting CREG_PAE, CREG_PAE_UPDATE is still
      written with stronger writel() since we don't want reordering to happen,
      otherwise value written to CREG_PAE won't be applied

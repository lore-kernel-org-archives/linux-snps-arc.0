Sure, and the reduced duplicity I propose doesn't change that in any way. The onus
is still on perf maintainers to copy over any unistd changes - in the new regime,
it will be just lesser since we only care about a handful of syscalls, not the
entire unistd.

Indeed.

Not sure how replacing the full header with just a small hunk, out of same header
out-of-line will change anything or cause any more breakage.

Sure it is, I'm proposing to make their work less, no more.

Exactly, it was a genuien mistake with a super prompt followup - your promptness
is really appreciated and emulation worthy for other maintainers including myself ;-)

Ok, well lets leave it at that for now then.

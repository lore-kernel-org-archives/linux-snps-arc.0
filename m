AFAIK the regular GPLv2 boilerplate is the standard throughout the kernel.

Please do.

What sort of arithmetic ? It's perfectly valid in general ...

The uXX is still prevalent in drivers/mtd/ according to git grep , so
I'd stick with that. Using uXX in U-Boot is perfectly fine and in fact
recommended.

What reason ?

Sigh, please be so kind and use -next for your development next time ...

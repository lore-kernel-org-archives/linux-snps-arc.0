The patch looks generally okay. I'd move all the logic to the clock
driver unless perhaps how to set the cpu freq is defined by the
architecture.

If any ARM platforms are doing something similar, then it's done in
their clock driver via of_clk_init. Or they just wait for cpufreq to
kick in and expect the bootloader has initialized things to a
reasonable frequency.

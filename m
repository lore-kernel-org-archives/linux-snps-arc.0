Please no - lets not bolt-in more hacks and instead try do this cleanly if
possible. And from other discusions it seems there might be a way. The readl
approach seems fine to me (with ioremap) if that is what it takes.

Right - 2 DT is not acceptable unless we are feeling bored and want more emails
for AXS board support :-)

 And fix-up I'm talking about

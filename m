To be honest: That's broken by design and you really should go and tell
your hardware folks to fix that. Proper timekeeping is essential for any
Operating System (not only Linux).

It's well known for more than TWO decades that changing the frequency of
the timekeeper clocksource is a complete disaster, but obviously every
hardware vendor has to learn that the hard way instead of simply learning
from history.

It does not forbid CPU frequency changes. It forbids timekeeper clocksource
frequency jumps.

For a very good reason. Having frequency jumps disturbs timekeeping in
several ways (monotonic behaviour, accuracy).

No, we won't add a special flag because the availability will just
proliferate completely braindead hardware designs.

We had a gazillion of horrible hacks which tried to make this work in the
past, but none of them ever worked reliably under all circumstances. We
won't bring them back.

Your hardware design is broken by making the clocksource clock depend on
the CPU frequency. Tell your hardware people to fix that or just use a
seperate independent clocksource.

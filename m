For the casual reader I'd add a comment why this was deleted.

Reading kernel/dma/* I see what you mean. We check @ioc_enable at the time of
registering the dma op for coherent vs. non coherent case, so there's common vs.
ARC versions of alloc/free for coherent vs. noncoherent. But then I'm curious why
do we bother to check the following in new arch_dma_(alloc|free) at all.

	if (attrs & DMA_ATTR_NON_CONSISTENT)

Isn't it supposed to be NON_CONSISTENT always given the way new code works ?

Back in 2016, Peter had fixed this file due to a problem I reported on ARC. See
commit f75d48644c56a ("bitops: Do not default to __clear_bit() for
__clear_bit_unlock()")
That made __clear_bit_unlock() use the atomic clear_bit() vs. non-atomic
__clear_bit(), effectively making clear_bit_unlock() and __clear_bit_unlock() same.

This patch undoes that which could explain the issues you see. @Peter, @Will ?

That unsigned int seems to be a change from the arm64 tree in next. It's
not upstream and it'll cause a (easy to resolve) conflict.

So this is really bad. We have implicit and explicit type casting to
int. And while we are at it can we please stop proliferating the existing
mess.

'op' and 'cmp' definitly can be unsigned int. There is no reason to cast
them to int.

oparg, cmparg and oldval are more interesting.

The logic here is "documented" in uapi/linux/futex.h

/* FUTEX_WAKE_OP will perform atomically
   int oldval = *(int *)UADDR2;
   *(int *)UADDR2 = oldval OP OPARG;
   if (oldval CMP CMPARG)
       wake UADDR2;  */

Now the FUTEX_OP macro which is supposed to compose the encoded_up does:

#define FUTEX_OP(op, oparg, cmp, cmparg) \
  (((op & 0xf) << 28) | ((cmp & 0xf) << 24)             \
   | ((oparg & 0xfff) << 12) | (cmparg & 0xfff))

Of course this all is not typed, undocumented and completely ill
defined.

> +	int oparg = (int)(encoded_op << 8) >> 20;
> +	int cmparg = (int)(encoded_op << 20) >> 20;

So in fact we sign expand the 12 bits of oparg and cmparg. Really
intuitive.

Yes, we probably can't change that anymore, but at least we should make it
very explicit and add a comment to that effect.

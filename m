I assumed that the trap instruction would trigger the register and
stack dump, as it does on all other architectures. The most common
way this is handled is to have one instruction that is known to trap,
and use that to trigger a BUG(), and have __builtin_trap() issue
that instruction as well.

You might also want to implement CONFIG_DEBUG_BUGVERBOSE
support to attach further data to it.

How about overriding abort() with the same instruction that
__builtin_trap() inserts on newer compilers then? That should
make the behavior consistent.

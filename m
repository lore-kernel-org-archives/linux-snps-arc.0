How to use this option in a useful way?

I see a bunch of defined constants under include/dt-bindings/.

If you are talking about code duplication across architectures,
you can include arm dtsi from arm64 dts, or vice versa.
This was made possible by the symbolic links
in scripts/dtc/include-prefixes/.

Could you please elaborate your issues if you cannot solve them
by the current strategy?

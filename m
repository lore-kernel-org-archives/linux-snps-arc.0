The hardware is being changed and I had a couple of questions to help do it right:

1. The clocksource timers TIMER1, GFRC, RTC etc will now be clocked independent of 
core using a fixed clk. Is there some magic freq value which best works so we can 
recommend that to implementors. AFAIKR ARM has 24 MHz.

2. I'm not sure if the timer generating interrupts (periodic or oneshot) needs to 
be fed invariant fixed clk or dynamic core clk. Naively it should follow the core 
- but what happens to scheduled timers (say TCP timeouts): if this clk changes - 
they need to be canceled/updated. If it doesn't then the notion of timing is 
broken ? I'm likely not thinking this through correctly.

Thx,

well, if this is a problem, then we can have

static inline void print_symbol(const char *fmt, unsigned long addr)
{
       printk(fmt, addr);
}

for CONFIG_KALLSYMS builds, and an empty print_symbol() for !CONFIG_KALLSYMS
builds.


but we still have tons printk(%pS) in the kernel and even print_ip_sym()
(which is not compiled out on !CONFIG_KALLSYMS). so it seems to me that
we can drop print_symbol()/__print_symbol() and switch to printk(%pS)
after all.

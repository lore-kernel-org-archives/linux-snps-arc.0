The kobject has a name, why not use that?

The kobject has a refcount, use that?  Don't have 2 refcounts in the
same structure, that way lies madness.  And bugs, lots of bugs...

And if this really is a refcount (hint, I don't think it is), you should
use the refcount_t type.

__ATTR_RO and __ATTR_RW should work better for you.  If you really need
this.

Oh, and where is the Documentation/ABI/ updates to try to describe the
sysfs structure and files?  Did I miss that in the series?

It's a page size, just use sprintf() and be done with it.  No need to
ever check, you "know" it will be correct.

Also, what about a trailing '\n' for these attributes?

Oh wait, why have a name when the kobject name is already there in the
directory itself?  Do you really need this?

Why the odd __vas* naming?  What's wrong with vas_release?

<snip>

You have a ton of inline functions, for no good reason.  Make them all
"real" functions please.  Unless you can measure the size/speed
differences?  If so, please say so.

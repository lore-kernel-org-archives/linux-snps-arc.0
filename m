Subject: [PATCH v5 0/2] DW DMAC: update device tree

It wasn't possible to enable some features like
memory-to-memory transfers or multi block transfers via DT.
It is fixed by these patches.

Changes for v5:
 * Update existing DTS. Pointed by Andy Shevchenko. 
 * Read multi-block per chanel instead of per master (Move 
   DW_DMA_MAX_NR_CHANNELS define from regs.h to dma-dw.h to
   implement this) Pointed by Andy Shevchenko.

Changes for v4:
 * Fix setting inverted value to "dwc->nollp". My fault - I 
   tested with wrong DTS, so DMAC was configured from autoconfig
   instead of device tree. Pointed by Andy Shevchenko.
 * Update "multi-block" diescription in documentation to be more 
   clear. Pointed by Arnd Bergmann.

Changes for v3:
 * Update existing platform data.
   We don't need to update existing DTS because default logic 
   wasn't change: we don't set "is_nollp" if we read 
   configuration from DT before. And we don't set it now if
   "multi-block" property doesn't exist in DTS.

Changes for v2:
 * I thought about is_memcpy DT property: all known devices, which 
   use DT for configuration, support memory-to-memory transfers. 
   So we don't need to read it from DT. So enable it by default, 
   if we read configuration from DT.
 * Use "multi-block" instead of "hw-llp" name to be more clear.
 * Move adding DT property and adding documentation for this
   property to one patch.

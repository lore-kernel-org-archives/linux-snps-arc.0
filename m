Oh, you're talking about "with random locations" case. Randomizing
each map just hopelessly fragments things no matter what you do on
32-bit. If you reduce the space over which you randomize to the point
where it's not fragmenting/killing your available vm space, there are
so few degrees of freedom left that it's trivial to brute-force. Maybe
"libs randomized in low 1GB, everything else near-sequential in high
addresses" works half decently, but I have a hard time believing you
can get any ASLR that's significantly better than snake oil in a
32-bit address space, and you certainly do pay a high price in total
available vm space.

Indeed this is the mother of all issues, I tried and system is clearly hosed with
and works after.
What's amazing is the commit 4aef66c8ae9 which introduced it is from 2016 ;-)
Back then we had a retry branch with backoff stuff which I'd reverted for new
cores and the merge conflict somehow missed it.

@PeterZ I'll create a patch with you as author ? do I need any formal sign offs,
acks etc ?

So after this there are 2 other things to be addresses / looked at still while we
are still here.

1. After 84c6591103db __clear_bit_lock() implementation will be broken (or atleast
not consistent with what we had after), do we need to reinstate it.
2. Will's proposed change to remove the underlying issue, but the issue in #1
remains ?

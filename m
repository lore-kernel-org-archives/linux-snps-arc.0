But then the problem is you are not setting up thread_info->cpu correctly. And
that needs fixing.
Say we already had ur next patch which doesn't assume 0 based masters, then is
this patch still needed.

Essentially this change can be taken as an optimization (mem vz. aux reg read) but
I don't think it is a fix !

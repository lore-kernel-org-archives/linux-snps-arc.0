I meant we are measuring when are happening the interrupts by getting the local
clock in the interrupt handler. But if the interrupts are coming from a timer, it
is not necessary to do that because we already know when they will occur.

So, in order to sort out which interrupt we measure, we use the IRQF_TIMER flag.

Unfortunately, this flag is missing when we do a request_percpu_irq. The
purpose of this patch is to fix that.

Ah, ok, sorry for that. Thanks for spotting this, you should have been Cc'ed by
my cccmd script. I will check that.

Mmh, yes. That's a good suggestion.

Agree.

Thanks for the review.

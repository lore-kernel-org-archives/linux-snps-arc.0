I came along source files for a few other software modules with similar
change possibilities.
Unfortunately, the corresponding developers are not convinced yet
to replace a call of the function "seq_printf" at the end by
a "seq_putc" because of software efficiency reasons.

Do you find this update suggestion acceptable to some degree
for the function "setup"?

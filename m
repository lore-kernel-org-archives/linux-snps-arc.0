Apologies if I'm missing some context here, but it's not clear to me why the
use of acquire/release instructions has anything to do with single-copy
atomicity of unaligned accesses. The ordering they provide doesn't
necessarily prevent tearing, although a CPU architecture could obviously
provide that guarantee if it wanted to. Generally though, I wouldn't expect
the two to go hand-in-hand like you're suggesting.

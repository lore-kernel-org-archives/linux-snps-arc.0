Note that in this particular case, the field will probably always be
aligned to 4 bytes,
as the struct will be allocated using *alloc().

Given m68k is 32-bit, it will access atomic64_t variables while
holding a spinlock,
so it should still be safe without this change.

Not to mention no one will try etnaviv on m68k ;-)

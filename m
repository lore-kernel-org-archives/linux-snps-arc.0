Consider this my ignorance of clk drivers, what exactly is the problem with that
readl() for FPGA ver. Having 2 versions of DT is annoyance for sure, but the
bigger headache is that it still won't help cases of users mixing and matching
boards and DT. IMO this runtime check is pretty nice and will support both types
of boards with exact same code/DT !

FWIW, both solutions #1 and #3 seem to imply a different DT - no ?

And I really don't see how #2 makes things more elegant/abstracted w.r.t clk
framework ?

So I prefer what you had before.

Subject: [PATCH 4/4] Update device tree Synopsys DW DMAC documentation

 * Rename is_private to is-private as ordered by DT policy.
 The change leaves the support for the old format.

 * Add is-memcpu property, so it is possible to
 enable memory-to-memory transfers support via DT.

 * Add hw-llp property, so it is possible to enable
 hardware multi block transfers support via DT.

 Fix white spaces.

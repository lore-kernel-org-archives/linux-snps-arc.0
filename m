Any other comments on this? I'd like to get the series into linux-next 
soon.

There was one other problem 0-day reported when building with 
CONFIG_OF=n while setting CONFIG_OF_ALL_DTBS=y on the kernel command 
line. The problem is dtc is not built as setting options on the command 
line doesn't invoke kconfig select(s). This can be fixed by also 
adding CONFIG_DTC=y to the command line, always building dtc regardless 
of Kconfig, or making 'all' conditionally dependent on 'dtbs'. I've gone 
with the last option as that is how this problem was avoided before. 

So the hunk in question with the 2 fixes now looks like this:

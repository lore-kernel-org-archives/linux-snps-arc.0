I see, thanks.

I think I was unclear. We need to tag an interrupt with IRQS_TIMINGS to record
their occurences but discarding the timers interrupt. That is done by checking
against IRQF_TIMER when setting up an interrupt.

request_irq() has a flag parameter which has IRQF_TIMER set in case of the
timers. request_percpu_irq has no flag parameter, so it is not possible to
discard these interrupts as the IRQS_TIMINGS will be set.

I don't understand how this is related to the the try_one_irq() fix you are
proposing. Am I missing something?

Regarding your description below, the host has no control at all on the virtual
timer and is not able to know the next expiration time, so I don't see the
point to add the IRQF_TIMER flag to the virtual timer.

I will resend a new version without this change on the virtual timer.

Just for my own curiosity, if there are two VM (VM1 and VM2). VM1 sets a timer1
at <time> and exits, VM2 runs and sets a timer2 at <time+delta>.

The timer1 for VM1 is supposed to expire while VM2 is running. IIUC the virtual
timer is under control of VM2 and will expire at <time+delta>.

Is the host wake up with the SW timer and switch in VM1 which in turn restores
the timer and jump in the virtual timer irq handler?

Didn't do ;)

Is Arnd's patch good to merge or do we need a fixup?

Subject: bug.h: work around GCC PR82365 in BUG()

Looking at functions with large stack frames across all architectures led
me discovering that BUG() suffers from the same problem as
fortify_panic(), which I've added a workaround for already.  In short,
variables that go out of scope by calling a noreturn function or
__builtin_unreachable() keep using stack space in functions afterwards.

A workaround that was identified is to insert an empty assembler statement
just before calling the function that doesn't return.  I'm adding a macro
"barrier_before_unreachable()" to document this, and insert calls to that
in all instances of BUG() that currently suffer from this problem.

The files that saw the largest change from this had these frame sizes
before, and much less with my patch:

fs/ext4/inode.c:82:1: warning: the frame size of 1672 bytes is larger than 800 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]
fs/ext4/namei.c:434:1: warning: the frame size of 904 bytes is larger than 800 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]
fs/ext4/super.c:2279:1: warning: the frame size of 1160 bytes is larger than 800 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]
fs/ext4/xattr.c:146:1: warning: the frame size of 1168 bytes is larger than 800 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]
fs/f2fs/inode.c:152:1: warning: the frame size of 1424 bytes is larger than 800 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]
net/netfilter/ipvs/ip_vs_core.c:1195:1: warning: the frame size of 1068 bytes is larger than 800 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]
net/netfilter/ipvs/ip_vs_core.c:395:1: warning: the frame size of 1084 bytes is larger than 800 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]
net/netfilter/ipvs/ip_vs_ftp.c:298:1: warning: the frame size of 928 bytes is larger than 800 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]
net/netfilter/ipvs/ip_vs_ftp.c:418:1: warning: the frame size of 908 bytes is larger than 800 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]
net/netfilter/ipvs/ip_vs_lblcr.c:718:1: warning: the frame size of 960 bytes is larger than 800 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]
drivers/net/xen-netback/netback.c:1500:1: warning: the frame size of 1088 bytes is larger than 800 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]

In case of ARC and CRIS, it turns out that the BUG() implementation
actually does return (or at least the compiler thinks it does), resulting
in lots of warnings about uninitialized variable use and leaving noreturn
functions, such as:

block/cfq-iosched.c: In function 'cfq_async_queue_prio':
block/cfq-iosched.c:3804:1: error: control reaches end of non-void function [-Werror=return-type]
include/linux/dmaengine.h: In function 'dma_maxpq':
include/linux/dmaengine.h:1123:1: error: control reaches end of non-void function [-Werror=return-type]

This makes them call __builtin_trap() instead, which should normally dump
the stack and kill the current process, like some of the other
architectures already do.

I tried adding barrier_before_unreachable() to panic() and fortify_panic()
as well, but that had very little effect, so I'm not submitting that
patch.

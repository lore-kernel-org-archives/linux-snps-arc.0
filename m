Thx for the link, very helpful. I've posted fix for ARC which uses software
interrupt and is thus UP/SMP safe.

Ok - so when I implement interrupt priorities (aka NMI for ARC), this needs to be
highest.

Not had a chance to go back to it since we last discussed.
I've just been swamped with bug fixing like this one :-(

Thx,

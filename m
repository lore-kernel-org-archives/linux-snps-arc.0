Because the console driver is supposed to parse the option string.
That allows in theory for the options to be specific for each console.
Maybe your earlycon driver is failing to do that.

No, we already have a defined way to set the baud, we don't need a
property in addition. Plus you didn't document it.

This seems fine to do here, but then we should also parse the other
standard options here too. And we should make sure we're not doing it
twice.

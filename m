Right thats what I feared. But hold on, I don't think we need to change the ABI to
achieve what we want. Gosh why did I even take that path.

Currently the errno switch case in perf_evsel__open_strerror() in doesn't handle
ENOTSUPP. So how about we add that - augmented with the same sample_period !0
check to barf for lack of sampling support.

Do you see anything wrong with that ?

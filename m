Hi Marek,

Thank you again for your feedback. I've applied a majority of your 
suggestions, and I am very happy with the result. I should have v2 
posted within a day or so.

ISO/IEC 9899:201x, Section 6.5.6, constraint(2) is not met when the one 
of the operands to addition is a void pointer.
Section 6.2.5 (19) defines void to be an incomplete type.

Being able to share the code between the different codebases where it is 
used.

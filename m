Subject: [PATCH 0/9] serial: Fix out-of-bounds accesses through DT aliases

	Hi all,

Serial drivers used on DT platforms use the "serialN" alias in DT to
obtain the serial port index for a specific port.  Drivers typically use
a fixed-size array for keeping track of all available serial ports.
However, several drivers do not perform any validation on the index
obtained from DT, which may lead to out-of-bounds accesses of these
fixed-size arrays.

While the DTB passed to the kernel might be considered trusted, some of
these out-of-bounds accesses can be triggered by a legitimate DTB:
  - In some drivers the size of the array is defined by a Kconfig
    symbol, so a user who doesn't need all serial ports may lower this
    value rightfully,
  - Tomorrow's new SoC may have more serial ports than the fixed-size
    array in today's driver can accommodate, which the user may forget
    to enlarge.

Hence this series fixes that by adding checks for out-of-range aliases,
logging an error message when triggered.

Tested on r8a7791/koelsch (sh-sci), all other drivers were
compile-tested only.

Thanks for your comments!

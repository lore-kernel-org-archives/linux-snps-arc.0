The commit you are referring to here sounds dubious in itself. We do not
want to stick a preempt_disable just to silence a warning. show_regs is
called from preemptible context at several places (e.g. __warn). Maybe
this was not the case in 2009 when the change was introduced but this
seems like a relict from the past. So can we fix the actual problem
rather than build on top of it instead?

Or maybe I am just missing something here.

Stephen saw that problem while building the Qualcomm driver
(CONFIG_PCIE_QCOM), and we fixed it by changing Kconfig so we won't build
that driver on x86.

That fix only affects CONFIG_PCIE_QCOM, so it won't help your driver.

You need some improvements to your drivers/pci/host/Kconfig patch -- some
help text and probably some dependencies.

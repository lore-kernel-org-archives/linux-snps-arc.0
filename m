Btw, given that I assume this is 4.20 material now, any chance we
could merge it through the dma-mapping tree?  I have some major changes
pending that would clash if done in a different tree, so I'd rather
get it all together.

I plan to kill this flag for 4.20 (or 4.20 at latest) in favor
of a better interface.  But your implementation looks ok, so I'm
fine with keeping it for now.

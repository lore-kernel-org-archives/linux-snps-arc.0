Well at least for me that's a confusion what is a reason to pass direction
to function which purpose is already known.

I'd say that XXX_sync_for_device() doesn't need _variable_ direction as an argument,
otherwise what does that mean if we pass DMA_FROM_DEVICE to that function?

That might easily be the case so good we caught that now and it will be fixed :)

I'll try your newer series now, thanks!

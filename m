dbg_master_lock must be owned to call kgdb_roundup_cpus() so
the calls to smp_call_function_single_async() should never deadlock the
calling CPU unless there has been a previous failure to round up (e.g.
cores that cannot react to the round up signal).

When there is a failure to round up when we resume, there is a window (before
whatever locks that prevented the IPI being serviced are released) during which
the system will deadlock if the debugger is re entered.

I don't think there is any point trying to round up a CPU that did not
previously respond... it should still have an IPI pending. The deadlock
can be eliminated by getting the round up code to avoid CPUs whose csd->flags
are non-zero either by checking the flag in the kgdb code or adding something
like smp_trycall_function_single_async().


Daniel.

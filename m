You mention IOC port in first line, but the change has nothing to do with it -
this is confusing.
Make this less verbose and just expand on the subject you have - global vs. per
device dma settings, without going into all the internal details.

And again going back to my original point, you are changing the semantics (ioc and
non ioc to co-exist) but everything still goes thru IOC port. That is different
that what we had before - everything goes through IOC port and ioc dma ops ONLY if
IOC existed.

I understand the need to isolate the 2 things and that is fine. But then what you
should do is
1a. introduce the per ioc dma settings in ARC - and not touch the DTBs.
1b. introduce the IO port settings in platform code
2. Now switch the DT binding to use the per device ioc

And any panic etc for IOC + highmem etc should be a separate patch - so we can
easily revert it when time is right !

I presume this has been tested with some stress testing bonie++ etc.

And further to Christoph's comment, if we decide to skip the branch, please add a
comment that it is already set in generic code etc.

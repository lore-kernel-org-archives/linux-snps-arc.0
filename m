Nope. So I would not try and use these generic events. In other news, it
seems like there's finally some progress on the JSON patches:

  https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20160831114254.GA9001 at krava

Which would make using non-standard events easier.

Again, nope. Perf event groups are single counter (so no implicit
addition) that are co-scheduled on the PMU.

That seems out-dated, Jiri added grouping support to perf-tool quite a
while back.

You can do it like:

	perf stat -e '{cycles,instructions}'

Which will place the cycles event and the instructions event in a group
and thereby guarantee they're co-scheduled.

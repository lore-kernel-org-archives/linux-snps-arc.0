s/configs/config
We only need one !

I'd say leave current axs103* defconfigs as to what they are - we can trim them at
leisure / seperately.
Introduce a new config item which matches the shipping axs product (NR_CPU = 2
etc) and a pairing defconfig
and add all the fancy stuff there ! They can continue to share the DTs
The other purpose of this config item is to elide the hack we have for setting clk
for SMP (so it remains 90 or 100)

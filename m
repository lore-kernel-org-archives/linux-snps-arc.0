Hi Marek,

Thank you very much for the comments. I am going to fix most issues you 
pointed out in v2. I do have some follow-up question on some of your 
comments, so please bear with me. I hope I have responded to all your 
comments, but feel free to nudge me if I missed any.

Yes, I do want that now!

I chose this form of the boilerplate because it seems to be quite used 
in other places. I am assuming the fatter boilerplate the requirement 
for drivers/mtd, correct?

Each stage of the QSPI chain has two registers. The second register has 
a bitfield which takes in the length of the stage. For example, for 
DATA2, we can set the length up to 0x4000, but for ADDR2, we can only 
set a max of 4 bytes. I wrote this comment as a reminder to myself to be 
careful about using this mask. I'll rephrase the comment for [v2]

I chose uintptr_t as opposed to void *, because arithmetic on void * is 
not valid in C. What is the right answer hen, without risking undefined 
behavior?

 From coding-style, section 5.(d), my understanding is that 
"Linux-specific u8/u16/u32/u64 types [...] are not mandatory in new 
code". Most of the code in this driver is shared between Linux, u-boot, 
openocd, ASIC validation tests, and manufacturing tests. Unlike, 
shortint types, stdint types are available in all cases.

Therefore, having to use a different set of primitive types makes code 
sharing much more difficult, and increases the maintenance burden, hence 
the strong preference for standard types. Is this reasonable?

That is very similar to ioread32_rep, yes. I kept this as for the 
reasons outlined above, but changing this to _rep() seems innocent enough.

Ooh, I see the API here has changed significantly from the 4.9 LTS 
branch where we originally developed the driver. I will add and test 
normal and FAST_READ support, but I won't have the bandwidth to test 
other modes yet. Those will have to remain as a TODO.

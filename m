Hi Mark,

Thanks for your comments.

I can change but my intention was to make this PCM a kind of extension to the
driver instead of adding a new module to the system.

Ok.

Indeed I thought about this and the interrupts must also be enabled when in DMA
mode. Although there is no interrupt handler in the original driver (without
this patches) in some setups the interrupt line may be connected to the DMA
controller. I will drop this change and always enable interrupts. Please note
that I don't have a setup with DMA support so I can only test using the PIO mode.

How should I then determine which mode to use?
    - Check if DMA parameters are declared in DT, or
    - Check if snd_dmaengine_pcm_register() fails, or
    - Assume PIO mode will be used when compiling with PIO PCM, or
    - Something else ?

So my approach was different - I felt it was cleaner to export same "interface"
from ISA specific code to ISA common code. It seemed more readable vs. the
explicit if check above in each function which was dependent on ISA.

Plus given that the ISA are not compatible, I wanted to ensure we were not mixing
(even by accident) any code for one into a build for other. This ofcourse means
that my original question / request is wrong in first place. With current
structuring of code, I need to make sure that such ISA specific #defines don't end
in ISA common code anyways.

So something like below

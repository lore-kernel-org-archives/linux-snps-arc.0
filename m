Sure.. find below.

I did not follow through the maze, I think the few archs implementing
this simply do not include this file at all.

I'll let the first person that cares about this worry about that :-)

Subject: bitops: Do not default to __clear_bit() for __clear_bit_unlock()

__clear_bit_unlock() is a special little snowflake. While it carries the
non-atomic '__' prefix, it is specifically documented to pair with
test_and_set_bit() and therefore should be 'somewhat' atomic.

Therefore the generic implementation of __clear_bit_unlock() cannot use
the fully non-atomic __clear_bit() as a default.

If an arch is able to do better; is must provide an implementation of
__clear_bit_unlock() itself.

Specifically, this came up as a result of hackbench livelock'ing in
slab_lock() on ARC with SMP + SLUB + !LLSC.

The issue was incorrect pairing of atomic ops.

slab_lock() -> bit_spin_lock() -> test_and_set_bit()
slab_unlock() -> __bit_spin_unlock() -> __clear_bit()

The non serializing __clear_bit() was getting "lost"

80543b8e:	ld_s       r2,[r13,0] <--- (A) Finds PG_locked is set
80543b90:	or         r3,r2,1    <--- (B) other core unlocks right here
80543b94:	st_s       r3,[r13,0] <--- (C) sets PG_locked (overwrites unlock)

Fixes ARC STAR 9000817404 (and probably more).

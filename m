Linus just merged it so it will be part of -rc4. In general, a one-off
patch being duplicate is not a big deal, but one dealing with renames
like this can cause conflicts when merged as two patches so it's
better to use a shared base.

In the future, if you anticipate this being needed, you can always
request the maintainer to apply the fix to a stable branch that you
can use as a base for your work. That way the specific commit will
only be in the tree once, even if it comes in via two paths.

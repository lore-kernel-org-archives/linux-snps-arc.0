I'm not sure I understand what you're proposing, Arnd, so let me
ramble and you can direct me back on course.

Currently drivers/pci/host/pcie-designware.c is not usable by itself;
it doesn't register a platform_driver.

There's hardly any code in Joao's patches; it looks like they add a
minimal wrapper around the functionality in pcie-designware.c and
register it as a platform_driver.

Are you suggesting that we should just add that functionality directly
in pcie-designware.c so that file could both be a minimal driver with
the functionality of Joao's patches, *and* continue to provide the
shared code used by all the existing DesignWare-based drivers?  Maybe
the platform_driver registration part could be controlled by its own
separate Kconfig option.

For example, he could make dw_pcie_link_up() look like:

  int dw_pcie_link_up(struct pcie_port *pp)
  {
    u32 val;

    if (pp->ops->link_up)
      return pp->ops->link_up(pp);

    val = readl(pp->dbi_base + PCIE_PHY_DEBUG_R1);
    return val & PCIE_PHY_DEBUG_R1_LINK_UP;
  }

That seems like it would make sense to me.  It would resolve the
filename question, since there wouldn't be a new file.  And if this is
merely a driver for the generic DesignWare core without any
extensions, I'm happy with some sort of "dw"-based driver name and
compatibility string.

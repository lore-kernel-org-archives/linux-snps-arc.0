FYI that your messages keep ending up in my spam folder and I just see
other people's replies.  Not exactly sure why...  Note also that your
patch really doesn't have all the tags in the right places.  All the
Tags including the Signed-off-by and Cc are supposed to be squashed in
one paragraph  ...and I believe "CC" is canonically supposed to be
"Cc".  Presumably the maintainer can fix this up when applying, but
please try to do better in the future.  Speaking of which, you didn't
include the dw_mmc maintainer (Jaehoon Chung) in your post?  That
seems not so great unless you know something that get_maintainers
doesn't know about who will apply this patch.

As far as the actual patch, at first I thought maybe we could avoid
the 64-bit math and just pre-divide bus_hz by MSEC_PER_SEC (just like
used to happen before my change), but I think there's still a chance
of overflow, right?  Because, for instance:

drto_clks can be a full 24 bits
drto_div can be effectively 9 bits

...we could do further tricks (further rounding up the result), but it
seems like just doing the 64-bit math is fine too unless someone has
any strong objections...

Could you please include a changelog below your commit message?
Otherwise it's barely possible to understand what that v2 improves/fixes.

Also it makes sense to send at least cover letter to all people mentioned
at least in one patch of the series. That gives an idea what this series
does and in particular why patch I'm mentioned in is required.

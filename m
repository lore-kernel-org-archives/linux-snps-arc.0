Okay if you want to leave debug options, but regardless you should use 
stdout-path instead.

Okay, I'd just do "cpu-interrupt-controller" for the node name then. 
There doesn't seem to be an easy way to use just "interrupt-controller" 
since you have 2 nodes at the same level and no unit-address (i.e. a 
reg property).

Because they are all broken in unique ways across different 
implementations and SoC integrations. Even IP licensed from the same 
vendor has differences.

earlycon gets the register address from the flattened tree. You could 
get the clock frequency too using the "clock-frequency" property.

You are running C code here and reading the FDT, it's not that early.

For 5 boards, what you have works fine. When you have 10? 100? 1000? Not 
so much.

The point of DT is to remove board specifics (and SoC specifics to some 
extent) from the kernel. Having board kconfig options is adding board 
specifics. This doesn't scale when you have hundreds of or a thousand 
boards (as the ARM world does).

The sort answer is: Per definition. They are defined to work together,
which is what makes __clear_bit_unlock() such a special function.

x86 (and others) do in fact use non-atomic instructions for
spin_unlock(). But as this is all arch specific, we can make these
assumptions. Its just that generic code cannot rely on it.

So let me try and explain.


The problem as identified is:

CPU0						CPU1

bit_spin_lock()					__bit_spin_unlock()
1:
	/* fetch_or, r1 holds the old value */
	spin_lock
	load	r1, addr
						load	r1, addr
						bclr	r2, r1, 1
						store	r2, addr
	or	r2, r1, 1
	store	r2, addr	/* lost the store from CPU1 */
	spin_unlock

	and	r1, 1
	bnz	2	/* it was set, go wait */
	ret

2:
	load	r1, addr
	and	r1, 1
	bnz	2	/* wait until its not set */

	b	1	/* try again */



For LL/SC we replace:

	spin_lock
	load	r1, addr

	...

	store	r2, addr
	spin_unlock

With the (obvious):

1:
	load-locked	r1, addr

	...

	store-cond	r2, addr
	bnz		1 /* or whatever branch instruction is required to retry */


In this case the failure cannot happen, because the store from CPU1
would have invalidated the lock from CPU0 and caused the
store-cond to fail and retry the loop, observing the new value.

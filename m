No, you could provide a common, shared function to call. Then each
platform can opt-in. If you can make something that applies to every
single platform now or in the future, then I'd put it in arch. If you
have plans to decouple the timer and cpu clocks, then sounds like you
can't.

IMO, if it's not part of the defined CPU architecture, then don't put
it in arch/. That's how we end up with multiple copies of the same
thing done arbitrarily different ways because few people look across
architectures.

No, I meant to point that out.

Ideally, you'd use the clock binding eventually. "clock-frequency" is
still allowed, but not both. You have to pick. Either you have simple
needs or you don't...

That's fine, but you need a good reason.

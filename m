I also believe this would be the better option but in the meantime can't I
integrate the audio like it is being done in the dw-hdmi driver[1]? In this
driver the audio is registered as a sound card and is conditionally built using
Kconfig, just like I was doing in the previous versions. I know you said the
HDMI audio is still an open issue but it seems that for this case it was accepted.

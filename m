That isn't sufficient. The core expects all calls to *any* of the host
ops to be serialized for one host. It does so to conform to the specs.

For example it may call:
 ->set_ios()
->request()
->set_ios()
->request()
->request()

Sorry, but no.

Well, that kind of explains your simplistic approach.

I would suggest you to study the specs and the behavior of the mmc
core a bit more carefully, that should give you a better understanding
of the problems.

Honestly, I don't think efforts of implementing this is worth it!

Even if we would be able to solve the problem from an mmc subsystem
point of view, we would still have the I/O scheduling problem to
address. To solve that, we would need to be able to configure upper
block layer code to run one scheduling instance over multiple block
devices...

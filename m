FWIW, I tested 8250_early with "keep_bootcon", and this fixes that:

Tested-by: Brian Norris <briannorris at chromium.org>

But then I get double console, if I have both a "real" and "early"
console.

If I were to *only* have the early console, then I might hit the
problems you mention:

Problems 2 and 3 look like something that's not really in scope for
early consoles. There's a reason they are mainly supported for early
boot, and we try to switch off of them. There isn't really a good way to
handle all the clock and PM infrastructure without...switching off the
earlycon and using the real one :)

So, I guess this patchset has value for systems where the clock/PM
requirements are simple enough, and the earlycon can actually be useful
beyond early init.

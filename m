Either way is fine, we just have to be a little careful about the
initialization ordering.

This is definitely good (after checking that all existing drivers
either work with the generic version, or provide their own callbacks
already).

The important part I think is that the new driver should not require
and code that is seen as soc-specific: If it works with any implementation
of pci-dw rather than a specific system, the driver should know how
to do the right thing.

It may be helpful to move the actual matching on the compatible string
and calling of the generic probe function into another module, if we
are going forward with loadable PCI host drivers as posted by 
Paul Gortmaker today. Otherwise we end up with a device being bound
to the generic driver when a more specific one exists and both
are loadable modules, because the generic driver is always loaded
first.  As long as both drivers are built-in, it works fine because
we first look for a driver matching the most specific compatible string.

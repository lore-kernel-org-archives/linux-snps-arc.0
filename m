And if we don't group them, then they _may_ not be co-scheduled (active/counting
at the same time) ? But how can this be possible.
Say we have 2 counters, both the cmds below

     perf -e cycles,instructions hackbench
     perf -e {cycles,instructions} hackbench

would assign 2 counters to the 2 conditions which keep counting until perf asks
them to stop (because the profiled application ended)

I don't understand the "scheduling" of counter - once we set them to count, there
is no real intervention/scheduling form software in terms of disabling/enabling
(assuming no multiplexing etc)

This needs to be CCed stable as it fixes a real bug for ARC.

FWIW, could we add some background to commit log, specifically what prompted this.
Something like below...

---->8------
This came up as a result of hackbench livelock'ing in slab_lock() on ARC with SMP
+ SLUB + !LLSC.

The issue was incorrect pairing of atomic ops.

slab_lock() -> bit_spin_lock() -> test_and_set_bit()
slab_unlock() -> __bit_spin_unlock() -> __clear_bit()

The non serializing __clear_bit() was getting "lost"

80543b8e:	ld_s       r2,[r13,0] <--- (A) Finds PG_locked is set
80543b90:	or         r3,r2,1    <--- (B) other core unlocks right here
80543b94:	st_s       r3,[r13,0] <--- (C) sets PG_locked (overwrites unlock)

Fixes ARC STAR 9000817404

To be able to override/use-generic don't we need #ifndef ....

Subject: [PATCH v2] devres: Really align data field to unsigned long long
List-ID: <linux-snps-arc@lists.infradead.org>
Message-ID: <20180708175621.6951-1-abrodkin@synopsys.com>
To: linux-snps-arc@lists.infradead.org

Depending on ABI "long long" type of a particular 32-bit CPU
might be aligned by either word (32-bits) or double word (64-bits).
Make sure "data" is really 64-bit aligned for any 32-bit CPU.

At least for 32-bit ARC cores ABI requires "long long" types
to be aligned by normal 32-bit word. This makes "data" field aligned to
12 bytes. Which is still OK as long as we use 32-bit data only.

But once we want to use native atomic64_t type (i.e. when we use special
instructions LLOCKD/SCONDD for accessing 64-bit data) we easily hit
misaligned access exception.

That's because even on CPUs capable of non-aligned data access LL/SC
instructions require strict alignment.

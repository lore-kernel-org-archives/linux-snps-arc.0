Subject: [PATCH] ARC: fix memory nodes topology in case of highmem enabled
List-ID: <linux-snps-arc@lists.infradead.org>
Message-ID: <20190401184242.7636-1-Eugeniy.Paltsev@synopsys.com>
To: linux-snps-arc@lists.infradead.org

Tweak generic node topology in case of CONFIG_HIGHMEM enabled to
prioritize allocations from ZONE_HIGHMEM to avoid ZONE_NORMAL
pressure.

Signed-off-by: Eugeniy Paltsev <Eugeniy.Paltsev at synopsys.com>

Tested on both NSIM and HSDK (require memory apertures remmaping and
device tree patching)

+ *
+ * CONFIG_HIGHMEM enabled:
+ *  - node 0: ZONE_NORMAL memory only.
+ *  - node 1: ZONE_HIGHMEM memory only.

+ * In case of CONFIG_HIGHMEM enabled we tweak generic node topology and mark
+ * node 1 as the closest to all CPUs to prioritize allocations from ZONE_HIGHMEM
+ * where it is possible to avoid ZONE_NORMAL pressure.

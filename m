The timer can only fire when the vcpu is running. If it is not running,
a software timer is queued, with a pointer to the vcpu struct.

Sure, but in this series, they all seem to be per-cpu.

And that's where this is really wrong for the KVM guest timer. As I
said, this timer is under complete control of the guest, and the rest of
the system doesn't know about it. KVM itself will only find out when the
vcpu does a VM exit for a reason or another, and will just save/restore
the state in order to be able to give the timer to another guest.

The idle code is very much *not* aware of anything concerning that guest
timer.

This information is not readily available. You can only find it when it
is too late (timer has already fired) or when it is not relevant anymore
(guest is sleeping and we've queued a SW timer for it).

If this interrupt does not happen on the host, we don't care.

The flag IRQF_TIMER is used by the spurious irq handler in the try_one_irq()
function. However the per cpu timer interrupt will be discarded in the function
before because it is per cpu.

IMO, for consistency reason, adding the IRQF_TIMER makes sense. Other than
that, as the interrupt is not happening on the host, this flag won't be used.

Do you want to drop this change?

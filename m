I was thinking on it. The patch of James Hogan, b0da6d4415 (asm-generic:
Drop renameat syscall from default list) doesn't do it for renameat(), so
I decided not to do it too. It's not so easy to disable syscalls because arch
may support few ABIs, and some of them may require the syscall. For example,
arm64 supports lp64, aarch32 and ilp32, and first two ABIs need renameat()
and getrlimit/setrlimit.

At now there's no arches that doesn't need renameat() and getrlimit/setrlimit,
and there will be no such arch in nearest future. So there will be no
dead code.

But I agree with you that we need make that implementations 
conditional. If I understand it correctly, we need something like
__ARCH_WANT_SET_GET_RLIMIT in all existing Kconfigs, correct?

I think this patch may be applied as is, and if needed I can send
another patch that disables renameat() and getrlimit/setrlimit soon.

James, what do you think?

Yury.

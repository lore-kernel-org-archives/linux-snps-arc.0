I think that would be wrong, but thanks for trying to help :)

The address on the device side is sometimes (often?) offset from the CPU
address. So eg. the device can DMA to RAM address 0x0 using address
0x800000000000000.

Identity would imply 0 == 0 etc.

I think "bijective" is the correct term, but that's probably a bit
esoteric.

cheers

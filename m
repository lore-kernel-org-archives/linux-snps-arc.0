Sorry, I did not realize that your submission was for the generic dw-pcie
implementation rather than a particular product integrating it.

I think in this case, we should do this completely differently:

How about putting all the new code into drivers/pci/host/pcie-designware.c
as functions that can be used by the other drivers in absence of a chip
specific handler?

Instead of providing a new instance of struct pcie_host_ops, maybe add
it as a default implementation in dw_pcie_link_up() and dw_pcie_host_init()
for drivers that don't provide their own. "hisi_pcie_host_ops" currently
provides no host_init() callback function, so you will have to change
the hisi frontend to a provide nop-function.

For all other drivers, check if they can be changed to use your generic
implementation and remove their private callbacks if possible.

I think the MSI implementation should be split out into a separate file
though, as not everyone uses this.

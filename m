So is this something you hit today?  If not, why is this needed for
stable kernels?

Are you going to hit this code with all types of structures?  What
happens when you do have an unaligned access?

You didn't cc: this address :(

Does this change the padding today for any other arches?  If so, does
the increased memory usage cause any noticable issues?

I looked through all 5 patches and they seem sane to me.  I didn't go
through and test them since Brian already tested the patches for the
one UART driver I'd have access to anyway.

As per my previous email, I don't see any need to solve all the
world'd problems with this patch series, plus the keep_bootcon seems
to be an experts / debugging type option and it seems sane if you need
to take care in using it.

So officially for the series (FWIW since I'm just an interested 3rd party):

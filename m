I always forget the exact details, but we do have to execute what is
called a serializing instruction to flush CPU state and force it to
re-read the actual instructions -- see sync_core().

Correct -- we do 3, like detailed in the other email. But we figured the
actual poking of text is the slow path anyway.

if one could somehow get the arch_static_branch*() things to
conditionally emit either the 2 or 4 byte jump, depending on the offset
(which is known there, since we stick it in the __jump_table), then we
can have arch_jump_label_transform() use that same condition to switch
between 2 and 4 bytes too.

I just don't know if it's possible :-/

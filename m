Even "better"!

Definitely the concept of that interface never thought enough and broken
by design.

Yes, and why do you need to check this on each IO read/write?
Please, switch to plain readX()/writeX() instead.

That's what I have referred quite ago. The driver should provide an
interface to tell potential caller what maximum block (number of items
with given bus width) it supports.

We have struct dma_parms in struct device, but what we actually need is
to support similar on per channel basis in DMAengine framework.

So, instead of working around this I recommend either to implement it
properly or rely on the fact that in the future someone eventually does
that for you.

Each driver which has this re-splitting mechanism should be cleaned up
and refactored.

I don't see cyclic transfers support in the driver. So, I would suggest
just drop entire prioritization for now. When it would be actual user
one may start thinking of it.

Just a rule of common sense: do not implement something which will have
no user or solve non-existing problem.

Descriptor is active until terminate_all() is called or new descriptor
is supplied. So, the caller has a quite time to check on it.

So, what's wrong on it by your opinion?

Of course, if you want to keep by some reason (should be stated what the
reason in comment) erred descriptors, you can do that.

It looks like you need more time to investigate how runtime PM works
from driver point of view, but you shouldn't call your PM callbacks
directly without a really good reason (weird silicon bugs, architectural
impediments). I don't think that is the case here.

What do you mean by "each"? I don't recall the driver which can handle
more than one *active* descriptor per channel. Do you?

In that case status of active descriptor == status of channel. That
trick (I also already referred to earlier) is used in some drivers.

Depends on your design.

If it would be just one C module it might make sense to use driver.c and
driver.h or just driver.c.

I see several drivers in current linux-next that are using latter and
some that are using former, and number of plain driver.c variant is
bigger.

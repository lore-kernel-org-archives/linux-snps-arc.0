For ARC, it is double win.

1. Fixes 3 -Wreturn-type warnings

| ../net/core/ethtool.c:311:1: warning: control reaches end of non-void function 
[-Wreturn-type]
| ../kernel/sched/core.c:3246:1: warning: control reaches end of non-void function 
[-Wreturn-type]
| ../include/linux/sunrpc/svc_xprt.h:180:1: warning: control reaches end of 
non-void function [-Wreturn-type]

2. bloat-o-meter reports code size improvements as gcc elides the generated code 
for stack return.

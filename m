Yes.

Ok, will then use the DT to pass the FPGA version register.

Can I use a property in the DT to pass this reference clock? something like this:
    snps,parent-freq = <0xFBED9 27000000>, <0x0 28224000>; /* Tuple
<fpga-version reference-clock-freq>, fpga-version = 0 is default */

Or use a parent clock? like:
    clk {
        compatible = "fixed-clock";
        clock-frequency = <27000000>;
        #clock-cells = <0>;
        snps,fpga-version = <0xFBED9>;
    }

It is important to distinguish between the different versions automatically, is
any of these solutions ok?

Best regards,
Jose Miguel Abreu

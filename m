Subject: [PATCH 0/2 v5] Add AXS10X I2S PLL clock driver
List-ID: <linux-snps-arc@lists.infradead.org>
Message-ID: <cover.1460451903.git.joabreu@synopsys.com>
To: linux-snps-arc@lists.infradead.org

The ARC SDP I2S clock can be programmed using a
specific PLL.

This patch series has the goal of adding a clock driver
that programs this PLL.

----

Changes v4 -> v5:
* Documentation update (as suggested by Alexey Brodkin)
* Changed compatible string to "snps,axs10x-i2s-pll-clock" (as suggested by Alexey Brodkin)
* Added DT bindings

Changes v3 -> v4:
* Added binding document (as suggested by Stephen Boyd)
* Minor code style fixes (as suggested by Stephen Boyd)
* Use ioremap (as suggested by Stephen Boyd)
* Implement round_rate (as suggested by Stephen Boyd)
* Change to platform driver (as suggested by Stephen Boyd)
* Use {readl/writel}_relaxed (as suggested by Vineet Gupta)

Changes v2 -> v3:
* Implemented recalc_rate

Changes v1 -> v2:
* Renamed folder to axs10x (as suggested by Alexey Brodkin)
* Added more supported rates

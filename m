Subject: [PATCH] devres: Really align data field to unsigned long long
List-ID: <linux-snps-arc@lists.infradead.org>
Message-ID: <20180706171504.10265-1-abrodkin@synopsys.com>
To: linux-snps-arc@lists.infradead.org

It looks like on most of architectures "data" member of devres struture
gets aligned to 8-byte "unsigned long long" boundary as one may expect:
if we don't explicitly pack a structure then natural alignment
(which matches each member data type) is used.

But at least on 32-bit ARC architecture ABI requires "long long" types
to be aligned by normal 32-bit word. This makes "data" field aligned to
12 bytes. This is still OK as long as we use 32-bit data only.

But once we want to use native atomic64_t type (i.e. when we use special
instructions LLOCKD/SCONDD for accessing 64-bit data) we easily hit
misaligned access exception.

That's because even on CPUs capable of non-aligned data access LL/SC
instructions require strict alignment.

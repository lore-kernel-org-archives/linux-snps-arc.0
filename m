I would still try to do this with if(IS_ENABLED()) or another macro
like you have above. The problem you ran into with the macro definitions
is that you have conflicting header files:

#ifdef CONFIG_ISA_ARCOMPACT
#include <asm/irqflags-compact.h>
#else
#include <asm/irqflags-arcv2.h>
#endif

This has other (small) problems too, because you get possibly conflicting
symbols (e.g. arch_local_irq_enable but also the register names) that
make it harder to follow what's going on when reading the code.
If you prefix all the defines in the two headers with the respective name,
you can just include both headers and avoid this:

static inline void arch_local_irq_enable(void)
{
	if (IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_ISA_ARCCOMPACT))
		return arccompact_local_irq_enable();
	else
		return arcv2_local_irq_enable();
}

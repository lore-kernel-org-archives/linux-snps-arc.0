That is correct. the '_fpga.dts' is the tree for the current emulation 
board. The plan is to use the fpga platform until the actual silicon 
arrives and is brought up. I included the _fpga dts in order to have a 
way to verify that the anarion DTSI compiles. I also plan to later 
remove the fpga dts once the actual silicon works.

Staged for [PATCH v2].

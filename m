When is that done though? During round_rate and recalc_rate the
parent frequency is passed into the function, so it should be
possible to use that if the tree is properly expressed.

Ok.

We're trying to split the consumer and provider APIs along struct
clk_hw and struct clk respectively. If we can have drivers only
registers clk_hw pointers and never get back anything but an
error code, then we can force consumers to always go through the
clk_get() family of APIs. Then we can easily tell who is a
provider, who is a consumer, and who is a provider + a consumer.
Right now this isn't always clear cut because clk_hw has access
to struct clk, and also clk_register() returns a clk pointer, but
it doesn't really get used by anything in a provider driver,
unless provider drivers are doing something with the consumer
API.

Presumably we'll have different compatible strings for the
different PLLs then? CLK_OF_DECLARE() will make it so that the
device node that matches never gets a ->probe() from a
platform_driver called on it. If you want it to be called twice,
then you need to use CLK_OF_DECLARE_DRIVER() instead.

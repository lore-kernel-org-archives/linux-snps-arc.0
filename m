Subject: [PATCH 0/2] GPIO: add single-register gpio via creg driver

Add single-register MMIO gpio driver for complex cases where
only several fields in register belong to GPIO and each GPIO
owns field with different length and on/off values.

Here is the example:

31            11        8         7        5         0   < bit number
|              |        |         |        |         |
[   not used   | gpio-1 | shift-1 | gpio-0 | shift-0 ]   < 32 bit MMIO
                   ^                  ^
                (3 bit)            (2 bit)
                   |                  |
                   |                  |
                   |           write 0x2 == set output to "1" (on)
                   |           write 0x3 == set output to "0" (off)
                   |
            write 0x1 == set output to "1" (on)
            write 0x4 == set output to "0" (off)

This is different from gpio-reg, gpio-mmio and gpio-74xx-mmio:
* They all don't support cases when GPIO output register have
  more than one bit per GPIO line.
* They don't support holes in MMIO register.
* They don't support cases when GPIO lines have different on/off
  values.

This driver supports GPIOs via CREG on various Synopsys SoCs/boards.

Will remove.

Ok.

I think that the DT approach would be better but I also think that using two DT
files with only one change between them is not viable. I can see some alternatives:
    1) Pass the region of FPGA version in reg field of DT so that writel is not
directly used;
    2) Create a dummy parent clock driver that reads from FPGA version register
and returns the rate;
    3) Last resort: Use two DT files for each FPGA version.

@Vineet, @Alexey: Can you give some suggestions?

Some background:
We are expecting a new firmware release for the AXS board that will change the
reference clock value of the I2S PLL from 27MHz to 28.224MHz. Due to this change
the dividers of this PLL will change. Right now I am directly reading from the
FPGA version register but Stephen suggested to use a DT approach so that this
rate is declared as parent clock. This would be a good solution but would
require the usage of two different DT files (one for the current firmware and
another for the new firmware), which I think is not ideal. What is your opinion?
Some other solutions are listed above.

Ok.

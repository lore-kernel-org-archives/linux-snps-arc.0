Guilty as charged. I really should switch back to Gnus. :-)

Ah, I think the commit message is confusing. (Or else I'm misreading
the patch now.) It's not quite that we're disabling the feature when
THP is enabled anywhere, but rather that we use the move_huge_pmd path
for huge PMDs and use the new code only for non-huge PMDs. (Right?) If
that's the case, the commit message shouldn't say "Incase THP is
enabled, the optimization is skipped". Even if THP is enabled on a
system generally, we might use the new PMD-moving code for mapping
types that don't support THP-ization, right?

Sure. I'm just pointing out that the 500x performance different turns
the operation into a qualitatively different feature, so if we expect
to actually ship a mainstream architecture without support for this
thing, we should make it explicit. If we're not, we shouldn't.

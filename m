Well, when I was using this in kernel 3.18 (with an older version of the driver)
I noticed that DVI mode was being used even when HDMI was connected so I forced
the driver to start in HDMI mode. There were some changes in the driver so it is
possible that this is no longer needed. Should I drop it?

I will move this ifdef to adv751_audio and use NOP functions.

I followed the code in Analog Devices tree where there is no call to
audio_exit() but indeed you are correct. I will add this call.

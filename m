I haven't heard of this feature before, but after shortly looking at the description
on the UML website it actually has some similarities with what I am proposing. But as
far as I can see this was not merged into the mainline kernel, was it? In addition, I
think that first class virtual address spaces goes even one step further by allowing
AS to live independently of processes.

This is exactly what happens at the end. The memory region that is described by the
VAS segment will be mapped in the ASes that use the segment.

IMHO it will be very difficult for the scheduler code to reach the same switching
time as the pure VAS switch because switching between VAS does not involve saving any
registers or FPU state and does not require selecting the next runnable task. VAS
switch is basically a system call that just changes the AS of the current thread
which makes it a very lightweight operation.

These patches will also improve the speed of the VAS switch operation. We are also
using the switch_mm function in the background to perform the actual hardware switch
between the two ASes. The main reason why the VAS switch is faster than the task
switch is that it just has to do fewer things.

Did I understand you correctly that you are proposing that the switching thread
should make sure by itself that its code, stack, ? memory regions are properly setup
in the new AS before/after switching into it? I think, this would make using first
class virtual address spaces much more difficult for user applications to the extend
that I am not even sure if they can be used at all. At the moment, switching into a
VAS is a very simple operation for an application because the kernel will just simply
do the right thing.

I'm aware that you're the musl author, but glibc somehow manages to
provide etext, edata and end, demonstrating that it does know where at
least some of the memory map lies.  Virtually everything after that is
brought into the address space via mmap, which at least glibc intercepts,
so it's entirely possible for a security-conscious libc to know where
other things are in the memory map.  Not to mention that what we're
primarily talking about here are libraries which are dynamically linked
and are loaded by ld.so before calling main(); not dlopen() or even
regular user mmaps.

Huh, I thought libc was aware of this.  Also, I'd expect a libc-based
implementation to restrict itself to, eg, only loading libraries in
the bottom 1GB to avoid applications who want to map huge things from
running out of unfragmented address space.

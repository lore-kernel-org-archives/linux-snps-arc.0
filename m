  We do it for GCC, so we can do something similar for clang.

  For GCC, the host toolchain is completely unrelated to the target toolchain. 
With clang, it's true that it's possible to use the target compiler for host 
builds as well, but don't we still need binutils? So in my mind, there would be 
a separate host clang toolchain and target clang toolchain.

  Unfortunately your series is rather large and has no Reviewed or Acked by 
tags... So it tends to languish on patchwork.

  Although I'm usually in favour of automatic dependencies, in this case I'd say 
it's worth adding an explicit config option.

  But then it would depend on both host and target GCC >= 12...

  Ouch, so we still can't reuse the existing host toolchain for the host parts? 
then it doesn't help that much, does it?

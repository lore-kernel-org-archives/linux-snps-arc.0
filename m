We can document that; it's everything less than PERF_TYPE_MAX:

	enum perf_type_id {
		PERF_TYPE_HARDWARE                      = 0, 
		PERF_TYPE_SOFTWARE                      = 1, 
		PERF_TYPE_TRACEPOINT                    = 2, 
		PERF_TYPE_HW_CACHE                      = 3, 
		PERF_TYPE_RAW                           = 4, 
		PERF_TYPE_BREAKPOINT                    = 5, 

		PERF_TYPE_MAX,                          /* non-ABI */
	};

... and maybe you could use "PERF_PMU_CAP_ABI_TYPES" to align with that
comment?

I appreciate the shortness, but I think it's misleading to tie this to
"RAW" specifically, when really this is a capabiltiy to say "please let
me try to init any events for non-dynamic types, in addition to whatever
specific type I am registered with".

I'm happy with TYPE in the name; it's just RAW specifically that I'm
objecting to.

Yes, I think it is.

Sure, but I think that separating 1 and 2 is an artificial distinction,
and what we really have is:

(a) Wants to handle (some of) the non-dynamic/common/ABI types (in
    addition to whatever specific type it was registered with). Needs to
    have a switch statement somewhere in pmu::event_init().

(b) Only wants to handle the specific type the PMU was registered with.

Yes, we're aligned on that.

I just think we should combine 1 and 2 (into categroy a as above), since
that removes the need to treat RAW specially going forwards.

I think that adding the cap to those 15 PMUs would take less time than
it has taken me to write this email, so I do not understand the
objection.

Mark.

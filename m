We do have a 2 byte TRAP_S u6 which is used for all/any trap'ing: syscalls,
software breakpoint, kprobes etc. But using it like x86 seems a bit excessive for
ARC. Given that x86 doesn't implement flush_icache_range() it must have I$
snooping D$ and also this machine wide IPI sync I$ must be totally under the hood
all hardware affair - unlike ARC which needs on_each_cpu( I$ line range).

Using TRAP_S would actually requires 2 passes (and 2 rounds of IPI) for code
patching - the last one to undo the TRAP_S itself.

I do worry about the occasional alignment induced extra NOP_S instruction (2 byte)
but there doesn't seem to be an easy solution. Heck if we could use the NOP_S /
B_S in first place. While not a clean solution by any standards, could anything be
done to reduce the code path of DO_ONCE() so that unlikely code is not too far off.

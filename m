Subject: [PATCH 0/8] Devicetree build consolidation

This series addresses a couple of issues I have with building dts files.

First, the ability to build all the dts files in the tree. This has been
supported on most arches for some time with powerpc being the main
exception. The reason powerpc wasn't supported was it needed a change
in the location built dtb files are put.

Secondly, it's a pain to acquire all the cross-compilers needed to build
dtbs for each arch. There's no reason to build with the cross compiler and
the host compiler is perfectly fine as we only need the pre-processor.

I started addressing just those 2 problems, but kept finding small
differences such as target dependencies and dtbs_install support across
architectures. Instead of trying to align all these, I've consolidated the
build targets moving them out of the arch makefiles.

I'd like to take the series via the DT tree.

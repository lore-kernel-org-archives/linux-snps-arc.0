So this will help force alignment of outer structures triggered by inner members,
but only for globals and perhaps those on stack. I'm not sure how this helps
aligning such  a struct allocated dynamically - we are not passing this extra
alignment info the the allocator API here. Surely the size will increase and we
end up with extra padding in the end as intended originally and pointed to by
Mark, but how does it help with alignment ? What am I missing ?

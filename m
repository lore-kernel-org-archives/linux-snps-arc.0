I believe that this is not a problem. If it was, we would most likely
need to solve it in the existing printk(%pS) callers.

Exactly.

BTW: print_symbol() looks weird to me because:

   + looks like a normal printk() but
   + only one format specifier (%s) is replaced
   + %s is used to print an address/pointer

IMHO, this is counter-intuitive and even error prone.
Also it makes people using crazy hacks like the one fixed
in 4th patch, see

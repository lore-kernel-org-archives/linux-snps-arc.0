Although I believe Arnd the most, I was not convinced abt this (see below why) so
did a bit of investigation and looks like this patch is indeed correct and Arnd as
always is right :-)

The current upstream kernel doesn't boot on BE configured AXS103 is stuck
similarly in uart. With this patch it comes up fine. My trouble was I'd seen BE
work (w/o this patch) in our internal 3.18 branch. Turns out that in 3.18, ARC
io.h used the asm-generic version of readX(). My patch b8a033023994 ("ARCv2:
barriers") to upstream introduced the io barriers for ARCHS and in the process
introduced our own readX() accessors, which were not the same as correct
asm-generic ver. Thus I inadvertently introduced this bug.

@Lada I will fix up the changelog to add some of the background behind this
change, and mark this for stable backport as well.

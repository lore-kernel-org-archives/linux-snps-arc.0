This patch set has the goal to add suppport for DesignWare PCIe RC in ARC
AXS10x. It includes the necessary tweaks to the ARC architecture, 
necessary tweaks to the PCI subsystem and a new driver (pcie-synopsys).
This new driver will be used extensively in the PCIe RC Prototyping Kit.

The patches were produced against Bjorn Helgaas' repository. It was properly
tested in an IP Prototyping Kit.

I don't like the changelog - it is way too verbose and doesn't say the exact
problem we are trying to solve. How about something like below ?

----->

??? ARC: Improve cmpxchg syscall implementation
???
??? This is used in configs lacking hardware atomics to emulate atomic r-m-w
??? for user space, implemented by disabling preemption in kernel.
???
??? However there are issues in current implementation:
???
??? 1. Process not terminated if invalid user pointer passed:
?????? i.e. __get_user() failed.
???
??? 2. The reason for this patch was __put_user() failure not being handled,
?????? for COW break scenario. The zero page is initially wired up and
?????? read by __get_user() succeeds. However a write by __put_user()
?????? doesn't complete the page fault handling due to the page fault
?????? disabling from preempt disable. And what's worse is we silently return
?????? the stale zero value from __get_user() to user space. So the fix
?????? handles the specific case by re-enabling preemption and explicitly
?????? fixing up the fault and retrying the whole sequence over.

OK ?

Ah, right.
Even x86 can enable OF and OF_UNITTEST.



Another solution might be,
guard it by 'depends on ARCH_SUPPORTS_OF'.



This is actually what ACPI does.

menuconfig ACPI
        bool "ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) Support"
        depends on ARCH_SUPPORTS_ACPI
         ...

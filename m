You mean something like this:

sound_playback: sound_playback {
    compatible = "simple-audio-card";
    [...]
    simple-audio-card,format = "i2s";
    [...]
}

adv7511 at xx {
    compatible = "adi,adv7511";
    [...]

    ports {
        [...]
        /* Audio Output */
        port at x {
            reg = <x>;
            endpoint {
                remote-endpoint = <&sound_playback>;
            }
        }
    }
}

?
